[v1]
 Father, to Thee a joyful song we raise 
 With all Thine own; 
 And in Thy presence sound a note of praise 
 To Thee alone; 
 Brought nigh, brought home to Thee— O wondrous grace, 
 That gives us now with Thine own Son our place.
[v2]
 How deep the holy joy that fills that scene, 
 Where love is known! 
 Thy love, our God and Father, now is seen, In Him alone; 
 As, in the holy calm of Thine own rest,
 He leads the praise of those Thy love has blessed.
[v3]
 He leads the praise! How precious to Thine ear 
 The song He sings! 
 How precious, too, to Thee— how near, how dear 
 Are those He brings 
 To share His place: ’twas thus that Thou didst plan; 
 Thou lovedst Him before the world began.
