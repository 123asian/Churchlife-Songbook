[v1]
 Our goal— the holy city with the Lord, 
 It is our portion ’tis where He’s adored; 
 Although our bodies still are living here, 
 Our spirits with our glorious Lord are there; 
 Our spirits with our glorious Lord are there.
[v2]
 Our goal divine— the new Jerusalem— 
 That holy city made for God with men; 
 For all redeemed, who have Your pathway trod, 
 Shall have the right to share the bliss with God; 
 Shall have the right to share the bliss with God.
[v3]
 And every time we t’ward that city gaze, 
 Then every time we long to see Thy face; 
 We long to hear the shout that calls to Thee, 
 With Thee to share Thy God eternally; 
 With Thee to share Thy God eternally.
[v4]
 Our heart’s desire is not the peace so sweet, 
 Our longed for hope is not the joy we’ll meet; 
 But Thou Thyself, Thou art “our hope,” O Lord, 
 For ’tis Thyself that will be our reward; 
 For ’tis Thyself that will be our reward.
