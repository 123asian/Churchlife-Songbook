[V1]
 Low in the grave He lay, 
 Jesus, my Savior! 
 Waiting the coming day, 
 Jesus, my Lord!
[V2]
 Vainly they watch His bed,
 Jesus, my Savior! 
 Vainly they seal the dead, 
 Jesus, my Lord!
[V3]
 Death cannot keep his prey, 
 Jesus, my Savior! 
 He tore the bars away, 
 Jesus, my Lord!
[C1]
 Up from the grave He arose, 
 With a mighty triumph oâ€™er His foes; 
 He arose a Victor from the dark domain, 
 And He lives forever with His saints to reign. 
 He arose He arose! Hallelujah! Christ arose!
