[v1]
 We are feeding on the living Bread, 
 We are drinking at the fountainhead; 
 And whoso drinketh, Jesus said, 
 Shall never, never thirst again. 
 What!  never thirst again? 
 No, never thirst again! 
 What! never thirst again? 
 No, never thirst again! 
 And whoso drinketh, Jesus said, 
 Shall never, never thirst again!
