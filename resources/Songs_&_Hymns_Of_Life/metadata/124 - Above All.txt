[v1]
 Above all powers, above all kings, 
 above all nature and all created things; 
 Above all wisdom and all the ways of man, 
 You were here before the world began 
 Above all kingdoms, above all thrones, 
 above all wonders the world has ever known;  
[v2]
 Above all wealth and treasures of the earth, 
 there’s no way to measure what You’re worth. 
 Crucified, laid behind a stone; 
 You lived to die, rejected and alone; 
 Like a rose, trampled on the ground, 
 You took the fall, and thought of me, above all.
