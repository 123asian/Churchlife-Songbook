[v1]
 Jesus, my Savior, is all things to me; 
 Oh, what a wonderful Savior is He, 
 Guiding, protecting, o’er life’s rolling sea, 
 Mighty Deliv’rer— Jesus for me. 
[v2]
 Jesus in sickness, and Jesus in health, 
 Jesus in poverty, comfort or wealth; 
 Sunshine or tempest, whatever it be, 
 He is my Safety— Jesus for me.
[v3]
 He is my Refuge, my Rock, and my Tow’r, 
 He is my Fortress, my Strength and my Pow’r; 
 Life Everlasting, my Day’s-man is He, 
 Blessed Redeemer— Jesus for me.
[c1]
 Jesus for me, Jesus for me,
 All the time everywhere, 
 Jesus for me.
