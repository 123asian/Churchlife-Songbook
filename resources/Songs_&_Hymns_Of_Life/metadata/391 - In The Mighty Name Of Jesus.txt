[v1]
 In the Mighty Name of Jesus, 
 When we bow before the Throne, 
 Many deadly foes are vanquished, 
 Many victories are won. 
[v2]
 When we plead the Name of Jesus, 
 Satan and his hosts must flee. 
 Jesus! Jesus! Precious Jesus! 
 In Thy Name is victory.
[v3]
 Soon shall come the blessed moment 
 When the battle shall be won, 
 When the Mighty Name of Jesus 
 Shall exalt us to the Throne.
[c1]
 Mighty Name! Mighty Name! 
 In that Name alone we win. 
 Mighty Name! Mighty Name! 
 Conquâ€™ring Satan, death, and sin.
