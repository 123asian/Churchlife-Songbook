[v1]
 With praise and thanksgiving there stands a great throng 
 In the presence of Jesus and sing this new song.  
[v2]
 All these once were sinners, defiled in His sight, 
 Now arrayed in pure garments, in praise they unite. 
[v3]
 He maketh the rebel a priest and a king, 
 He hath bought us, and taught us this new song to sing.
[v4]
 How helpless and hopeless we sinners had been,
 If He never had loved us till cleansed from our sin.
[v5]
 Aloud in His praises our voices shall ring,
 So that others, believing, this new song shall sing.
[c1]
 Unto Him Who hath loved us and washed us from sin, 
 Unto Him be the glory forever! Amen!
