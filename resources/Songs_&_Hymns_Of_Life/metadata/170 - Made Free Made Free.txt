[v1]
 Made free! Made free! O captive! 
 Bound by the law of sin, 
 The law of life in Spirit 
 Will quicken you within.
 And counting on the Spirit, 
 His life shall now control 
 The members of your body, 
 The portals of your soul.
[v2]
 Made free! Made free in Jesus: 
 For crucified with Him, 
 From center to circumf’rence, 
 He breaks the pow’r of sin. 
 No longer act in body 
 As if it had no “law”; 
 His “law of life” must govern 
 All that ran wild before.
[v3]
 Made free! Made free in Jesus: 
 Deep planted in His death, 
 He liberates His life pow’r, 
 And breathes His Spirit’s breath. 
 Then waxing strong in spirit, 
 With force of quick’ning life; 
 The soul and body governed, 
 Its members cease from strife!
[v4]
 Made free! Made free in Jesus: 
 Joined to the Risen One, 
 By conflict prayer you triumph, 
 And claim His vict’ry won. 
 Freed with His glorious freedom,
 Above the darkness rife; 
 For now the law of sin and death
 Is conquered by His life.
