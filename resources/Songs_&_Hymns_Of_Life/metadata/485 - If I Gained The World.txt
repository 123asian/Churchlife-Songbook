[v1]
 If I gained the world, but lost the Savior, 
 Were my life worth living for a day? 
 Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort 
 In the things that soon must pass away? 
 If I gained the world, but lost the Savior, 
 Would my gain be worth the lifelong strife?
 Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing 
 For a moment with a Christ-filled life?
[v2]
 Had I wealth and love in fullest measure, 
 And a name revered both far and near, 
 Yet no hope beyond, no harbor waiting, 
 Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer; 
 If I gained the world, but lost the Savior, 
 Who endured the cross and died for me, 
 Could then all the world afford a refuge, 
 Whither, in my anguish, I might flee?
[v3]
 O what emptiness!— without the Savior 
 ’Mid the sins and sorrows here below! 
 And eternity, how dark without Him! 
 Only night and tears and endless woe! 
 What, though I might live without the Savior, 
 When I come to die, how would it be? 
 O to face the valley’s gloom without Him! 
 And without Him all eternity!
[v4]
 O the joy of having all in Jesus! 
 What a balm the broken heart to heal! 
 Ne’er a sin so great, but He’ll forgive it, 
 Nor a sorrow that He does not feel! 
 If I have but Jesus, only Jesus, 
 Nothing else in all the world beside— 
 O then everything is mine in Jesus; 
 For my needs and more He will provide.
