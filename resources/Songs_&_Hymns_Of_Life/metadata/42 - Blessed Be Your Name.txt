[V1]
Blessed be Your name

When the world's all as it should be
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be Your name

Though there's pain in the offering
Blessed be Your name
[V2]
Blessed be Your name
When the sun's shining down on me
When the world's all as it should be
Blessed be Your name
Blessed be Your name

Though there's pain in the offering
Blessed be Your name
[C1]
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name (Jesus!)
Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name
[B1]
You give and take awayF
You give and take away

Lord, blessed be Your name
[P1]
Every blessing You pour out I'll turn back to praise
When the darkness closes in Lord still I will say:
