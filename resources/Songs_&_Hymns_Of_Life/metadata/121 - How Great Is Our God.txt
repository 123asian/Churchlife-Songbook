[v1]
 The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty; 
 Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice 
 He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
 and trembles at His voice, and trembles at His voice. 
[v2]
 And age to age He stands, and time is in His hands; 
 Beginning and the End, Beginning and the End. 
 The Godhead, three in one, Father, Spirit, Son, 
 the Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb. 
[v3]
 Name above all names, worthy of all praise. 
 My heart will sing: How great is our God!  
[c1]
 How great is our God! Sing with me: 
 How great is our God! And all will see how great, how great is our God!
