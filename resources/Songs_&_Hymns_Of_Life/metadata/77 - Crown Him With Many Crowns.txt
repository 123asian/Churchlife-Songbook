[v1]
 Crown Him with many crowns, 
 The Lamb upon His throne; 
 Hark! how the heav’nly anthem drowns 
 All music but its own! 
 Awake, my soul, and sing 
 Of Him who died for thee, 
 And hail Him as thy matchless King 
 Through all eternity.
[v2]
 Crown Him the virgin’s Son, 
 The God incarnate born, 
 Whose arm those crimson trophies won 
 Which now His brow adorn; 
 Fruit of the mystic Tree, 
 As of that Tree the Stem; 
 The Root whence flows Thy mercy free, 
 The Babe of Bethlehem.
[v3]
 Crown Him the Lord of love: 
 Behold His hands and side; 
 Rich wounds yet visible above 
 In beauty glorified; 
 No angel in the sky 
 Can fully bear that sight, 
 But downward bends his burning eye 
 At mysteries so bright.
[v4]
 Crown Him the Lord of peace,
 Whose pow’r a scepter sways
 From pole to pole, that wars may cease,
 And all be prayer and praise.
 His reign shall know no end,
 And round His piercéd feet
 Fair flow’rs of glory now extend
 Their fragrance ever sweet.
[v5]
 Crown Him the Lord of years,
 The Potentate of time,
 Creator of the rolling spheres,
 Ineffably sublime.
 All hail, Redeemer, hail!
 For Thou hast died for me;
 Thy praise shall never, never fail
 Throughout eternity.
