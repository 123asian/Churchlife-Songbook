[v1]
 I have a Friend, whose faithful love 
 Is more than all the world to me: 
 ’Tis higher than the heights above, 
 And deeper than the soundless sea; 
 So old, so new, So strong, so true; 
 Before the earth received its frame, 
 He loved me — Blessed be His name!
[v2]
 He held the highest place above, 
 Adored by all the sons of flame, 
 Yet such His self-denying love, 
 He laid aside His crown and came 
 To seek the lost, And at the cost 
 Of heav’nly rank and earthly fame, 
 He sought me — Blessed be His name!
[v3]
 It was a lonely path He trod, 
 From every human soul apart; 
 Known only to Himself and God 
 Was all the grief that filled His heart, 
 Yet from the track He turned not back, 
 Till where I lay in want and shame, 
 He found me — Blessed be His name!
[v4]
 Then dawned at last that day of dread,
 When desolate, yet undismayed,
 With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head,
 He, Godforsaken, man-betrayed,
 Was then made sin on Calvary,  
 And, dying there in grief and shame,
 He saved me — Blessed be His name!
[v5]
 Long as I live my song shall tell
 The wonders of His dying love;
 And when at last I go to dwell
 With Him His sovereign grace to prove,
 My joy shall be His face to see, 
 And bowing there with loud acclaim
 I’ll praise Him — Blessed be His name!
