[v1]
 Many weary years I vainly sought a spring, 
 One that never would run dry; 
 Unavailing all that earth to me could bring, 
 Nothing seemed to satisfy. 
[v2]
 Thru the desert land of sin I roam no more, 
 For I find a living Spring, 
 And my cup of gladness now is running oâ€™er, 
 Jesus is my Lord and King.
[v3]
 Here is sweet contentment as the days go by, 
 Here is holy peace and rest; 
 Here is consolation as the moments fly, 
 Here my heart is always blest.
[v4]
 Here I find a never ending, sure supply, 
 While the endless ages roll; 
 To this healing Fountain I would ever fly, 
 There to bathe my weary soul.
[c1]
 Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry, 
 Drinking at the Fountain of life am I; 
 Finding joy and pleasure 
 In abounding measure, 
 I am drinking at the Fountain of life.
