[v1]
 Having seen the world’s fair beauty, 
 Now I would be blind once more, 
 Lest I lose the loving Presence 
 And Delight I knew before. 
[v2]
 Dawn and sunset, star and moonlight, 
 I can see in paradise, 
 But while here on earth His mercy 
 For my blindness will suffice. 
[v3]
 I no more would be delivered 
 From my thorn, but look for grace, 
 While within the veil His glory 
 Shineth brightly on my face.
[v4]
 In the deep dark night, His beauty
 I by faith, not sight, may trace;
 He was ridiculed and hated,
 Yet I see His glorious face.
[v5]
 Sun and moonlight far surpassing,
 Clouds and Milky Way o’er-spread,
 Is the glory all transcending
 Shining from His thorn-crowned head.
[c1]
 Having seen the world’s fair beauty, 
 Now I would be blind once more, 
 Lest I lose Thy loving Presence 
 And Delight I knew before.
