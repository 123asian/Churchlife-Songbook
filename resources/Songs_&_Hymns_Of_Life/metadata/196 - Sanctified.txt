[v1]
 Church of God, beloved and chosen, 
 Church of Christ for whom He died, 
 Claim your gifts and praise the Giver, 
 You are washed and sanctified. 
 Sanctified by God the Father, 
 And by Jesus Christ His Son, 
 And by God the Holy Spirit, 
 Holy, holy Three in One.
[v2]
 By His will He sanctifieth, 
 By the Spirit’s pow’r within; 
 By the loving hand that chast’neth 
 Fruits of righteousness to win; 
 By His truth and by His promise, 
 By the Word, His gift unpriced, 
 By His own blood, and by union 
 With the risen life of Christ.
[v3]
 Holiness by faith in Jesus, 
 Not by effort of your own, 
 Sin’s dominion crushed and broken 
 By the pow’r of grace alone, 
 Christ, the holiness within you, 
 His own beauty on your brow: 
 This shall be your pilgrim brightness, 
 This your blessed portion now.
[v4]
 He will sanctify you wholly; 
 Body, spirit, soul shall be 
 Blameless till your Savior’s coming 
 In His glorious majesty!
 He has perfected forever 
 Those whom He has sanctified; 
 Spotless, glorious, and holy, 
 Is the Church, His chosen Bride.
