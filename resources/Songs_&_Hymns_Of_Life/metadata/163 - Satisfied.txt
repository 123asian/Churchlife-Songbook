[v1]
 All my life I had a longing 
 For a drink from some clear spring, 
 That I hoped would quench the burning 
 Of the thirst I felt within. 
[v2]
 Feeding on the husks around me, 
 Till my strength was almost gone, 
 Longed my soul for something better, 
 Only still to hunger on.
[v3]
 Poor I was, and sought for riches, 
 Something that would satisfy, 
 But the dust I gathered round me 
 Only mocked my soulâ€™s sad cry.
[v4]
 Well of water, ever springing, 
 Bread of life, so rich and free, 
 Untold wealth that never faileth, 
 My Redeemer is to me.
[c1]
 Hallelujah! I have found Him 
 Whom my soul so long has craved! 
 Jesus satisfies my longings; 
 Through His blood I now am saved.
