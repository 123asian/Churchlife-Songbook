[v1]
 Am I a soldier of the Cross— 
 A follow’r of the Lamb? 
 And shall I fear to own His cause, 
 Or blush to speak His name? 
[v2]
 Must I be carried to the skies 
 On flow’ry beds of ease, 
 While others fought to win the prize 
 And sailed through bloody seas?
[v3]
 Are there no foes for me to face? 
 Must I not stem the flood? 
 Is this vile world a friend to grace, 
 To help me on to God?
[v4]
 Since I must fight if I would reign, 
 Increase my courage, Lord!  
 I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain, 
 Supported by Thy Word.
[c1]
 In the name, the precious name, 
 Of Him who died for me, 
 Through grace I’ll win the promised crown, 
 Whate’er my cross may be.
