[v1]
 When I survey the wondrous cross 
 on which the Prince of Glory died, 
 My richest gain I count but loss, 
 and pour contempt on all my pride.
[v2]
 See from His head, His hands, His feet, 
 sorrow and love flow mingled down; 
 Did e’er such love and sorrow meet, 
 or thorns compose so rich a crown? 
[v3]
 Were the whole realm of nature mine, 
 that were an off’ring far too small, 
 Love so amazing so divine, 
 demands my soul, my life, my all.
[c1]
 O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross 
 bids me come and die and find that I may truly live. 
 O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross 
 All who gather here by grace draw near and bless Your name.
