[v1]
 Weak is my will, weak is my word; 
 Hope is there none for me, 
 Save in the strength Thou dost afford 
 To those that trust in Thee.
[v2]
 All, all has failed, that I call mine, 
 And all is failing still; 
 No strength I trust, but Strength Divine, 
 To hold me in Thy will.
[v3]
 My soul when lifted up, is nigh 
 To danger and to fall, 
 I dare not strive, I will not cry, 
 I need Thee—that is all.
[v4]
 Thou art my Savior, tender, strong, 
 Thy face O Lord I seek, 
 For by Thy strength I’m borne along, 
 Though weakest of the weak.
