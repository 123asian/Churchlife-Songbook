[v1]
 My Jesus, as Thou wilt! 
 Oh, may Thy will be mine! 
 Into Thy hand of love 
 I would my all resign; 
 Through sorrow, or through joy, 
 Conduct me as Thine own, 
 And help me still to say, 
 My Lord, Thy will be done!
[v2]
 My Jesus, as Thou wilt! 
 Though seen through many a tear, 
 Let not my star of hope 
 Grow dim or disappear;
 Since Thou on earth hast wept, 
 And sorrowed oft alone, 
 If I must weep with Thee, 
 My Lord, Thy will be done!
[v3]
 My Jesus, as Thou wilt! 
 All shall be well for me; 
 Each changing future scene 
 I gladly trust with Thee. 
 Straight to Thy rest above 
 I travel calmly on, 
 And sing, in life or death, 
 My Lord, Thy will be done!
