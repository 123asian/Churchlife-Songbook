[v1]
Oh do draw me dearest Lord, 
 I will follow close to You. 
 You’re so full so boundless, Lord; 
 More than I could hope to know. 
 Like a pretty henna flow’r 
 Blooming in the barren field; 
 As the myrrh with fragrance sweet 
 Deeply in my heart concealed. 
 Oh, do hear my whisper, Lord,   
 There’s no other Lord but You. 
 As Your riches I partake, 
 In Your life, mature I’ll be.
