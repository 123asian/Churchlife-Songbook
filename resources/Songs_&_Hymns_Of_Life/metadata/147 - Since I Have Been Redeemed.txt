[v1]
 I have a song I love to sing, 
 Since I have been redeemed,  
 Of my Redeemer, Savior, King, 
 Since I have been redeemed.
[v2]
 I have a Christ that satisfies, 
 Since I have been redeemed,  
 To do His will my highest prize, 
 Since I have been redeemed.
[v3]
 I have a witness bright and clear, 
 Since I have been redeemed, 
 Dispelling every doubt and fear, 
 Since I have been redeemed.
[v4]
 I have a joy I can’t express,
 Since I have been redeemed,
 All through the Lord, my righteousness
 Since I have been redeemed.
[v5]
 I have a God who is for me,
 Since I have been redeemed,
 With whom I’ll dwell eternally
 Since I have been redeemed.
[c1]
 Since I have been redeemed, 
 Since I have been redeemed, 
 I will glory in His name; 
 Since I have been redeemed, 
 I will glory in the Savior’s name.
