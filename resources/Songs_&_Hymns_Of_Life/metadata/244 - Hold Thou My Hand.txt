[v1]
 Hold Thou my hand; so weak I am, and helpless; 
 I dare not take one step without Thy aid. 
 Hold Thou my hand: for then, O loving Savior, 
 No dread of ill shall make my soul afraid.
[v2]
 Hold Thou my hand, and closer, closer draw me 
 To Thy dear self, my hope, my joy, my all; 
 Hold Thou my hand: lest haply I should wander, 
 And missing Thee, my trembling feet should fall.
[v3]
 Hold Thou my hand; the way is dark before me 
 Without the sunlight of Thy face divine; 
 But when by faith I catch its radiant glory, 
 What heights of joy, what rapturous songs are mine!
