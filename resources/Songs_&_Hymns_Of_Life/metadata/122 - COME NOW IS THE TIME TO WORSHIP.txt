[v1]
 One day every tongue will confess You are God; 
 One day every knee will bow; 
 Still the greatest treasure remains for those who gladly choose You now.
[v2]
 Willingly we choose to surrender our lives; 
 Willingly our knees will bow; 
 With all our heart, soul, mind and strength we gladly choose You now.
[c1]
 Come, now is the time to worship; 
 Come, now is the time to give your heart; 
 Come, just as you are to worship; 
 Come, just as you are before your God, come.
