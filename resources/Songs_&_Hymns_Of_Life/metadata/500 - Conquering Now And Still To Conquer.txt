[v1]
 Conquering now and still to conquer, 
 Rideth a King in His might, 
 Leading the host of all the faithful 
 Into the midst of the fight; 
 See them with courage advancing, 
 Clad in their brilliant array, 
 Shouting the name of their Leader, 
 Hear them exultingly say: 
[v2]
 Conquering now and still to conquer, 
 Who is this wonderful King? 
 Whence are the armies which He leadeth 
 While of His glory they sing? 
 He is our Lord and Redeemer, 
 Savior and Monarch divine;  
 They are the stars that forever 
 Bright in His kingdom will shine.
[v3]
 Conquering now and still to conquer, 
 Jesus, Thou Ruler of all, 
 Thrones and their scepters all shall perish, 
 Crowns and their splendor shall fall, 
 Yet shall the armies Thou leadest 
 Faithful and true to the last, 
 Find in Thy kingdom eternal 
 Rest, when their warfare is past.
[c1]
 “Not to the strong is the battle, 
 Not to the swift is the race; 
 Yet to the true and the faithful 
 Vict’ry is promised through grace.”
