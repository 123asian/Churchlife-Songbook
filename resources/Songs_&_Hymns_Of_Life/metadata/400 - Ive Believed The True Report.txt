[v1]
 I’ve believed the true report, 
 Hallelujah to the Lamb! 
 I have passed the outer court, 
 O glory be to God! 
 I am all on Jesus’ side, 
 On the altar sanctified, 
 To the world and sin I’ve died, 
 Hallelujah to the Lamb! 
[v2]
 I’m a king and priest to God, 
 Hallelujah to the Lamb! 
 By the cleansing of the blood, 
 O glory be to God! 
 By the Spirit’s pow’r and light, 
 I am living day and night, 
 In the holiest place so bright, 
 Hallelujah to the Lamb!
[v3]
 I have passed the outer veil, 
 Hallelujah to the Lamb! 
 Which did once God’s light conceal, 
 O glory be to God! 
 But the blood has brought me in 
 To God’s holiness so clean, 
 Where there’s death to self and sin, 
 Hallelujah to the Lamb!
[v4]
 I’m within the holiest pale,  
 Hallelujah to the Lamb! 
 I have passed the inner veil, 
 O glory be to God! 
 I am sanctified to God 
 By the power of the blood, 
 Now the Lord is my abode, 
 Hallelujah to the Lamb!
[c1]
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
 I have passed the riven veil, 
here the glories never fail, 
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
I am living in the presence of the King.
