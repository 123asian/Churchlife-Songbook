[v1]
 Breathe on me, Breath of God, 
 Fill me with life anew, 
 That I may love what Thou dost love, 
 And do what Thou wouldst do.
[v2]
 Breathe on me, Breath of God, 
 Until my heart is pure, 
 Until with Thee I will one will, 
 To do and to endure.
[v3]
 Breathe on me, Breath of God, 
 Blend all my soul with Thine, 
 Until this earthly part of me 
 Glows with Thy fire divine.
[v4]
 Breathe on me, Breath of God, 
 So shall I never die, 
 But live with Thee the perfect life 
 Of Thine eternity.
