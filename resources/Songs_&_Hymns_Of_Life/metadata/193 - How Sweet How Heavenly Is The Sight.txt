[v1]
 How sweet, how heav’nly is the sight, 
 When those who love the Lord 
 In one another’s peace delight, 
 And so fulfill His Word.
[v2]
 When each can feel his brother’s sigh, 
 And with him bear a part; 
 When sorrow flows from eye to eye, 
 And joy from heart to heart.
[v3]
 When, free from envy, scorn and pride, 
 Our wishes all above,
 Each can his brother’s failings hide, 
 And show a brother’s love.
[v4]
 When love, in one delightful stream, 
 Through every bosom flows; 
 When union sweet, and dear esteem, 
 In every action glows.
[v5]
 Love is the golden chain that binds;
 The saints Thy grace thus prove.
 And he is glory’s heir that finds
 His bosom glow with love.
