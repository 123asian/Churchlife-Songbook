[v1]
 Precious Lord, take my hand, 
 Lead me on, help me stand. 
 I am tired, I am weak, I am worn. 
 Through the storm, through the night,
 Lead me on to the light. 
 Take my hand, precious Lord; lead me home.
[v2]
 When my way grows drear, 
 Precious Lord, linger nearâ€” 
 When my life is almost gone. 
 Hear my cry, hear my call, 
 Hold my hand lest I fall. 
 Take my hand, precious Lord; lead me home.
[v3]
 When the darkness appears and the night draws near
 And the day is past and gone
 At the river I stand
 Guide my feet, hold my hand
 Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home
