[v1]
 ’Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus, 
 Just to take Him at His word; 
 Just to rest upon His promise; 
 Just to know, “Thus saith the Lord!” 
[v2]
 O how sweet to trust in Jesus, 
 Just to trust His cleansing blood; 
 Just in simple faith to plunge me, 
 ’Neath the healing, cleansing flood.
[v3]
 Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus, 
 Just from sin and self to cease; 
 Just from Jesus simply taking 
 Life and rest, and joy and peace.
[v4]
 I’m so glad I learned to trust Thee, 
 Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend; 
 And I know that Thou art with me, 
 Wilt be with me to the end.
[c1]
 Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him, 
 How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er, 
 Jesus, Jesus, Precious Jesus! 
 O for grace to trust Him more.
