[v1]
 Lord, hast Thou not one word for me 
 To bind my soul more close to Thee, 
 That every evil I may flee; 
 One word, O Lord, one word from Thee?
[v2]
 One word, to show how weak am I 
 When in my strength alone I try, 
 In vain I toil, in vain I sigh; 
 One word, O Lord, one word from Thee.
[v3]
 One word, to show how near Thou art, 
 For Thou dost dwell within my heart; 
 And of Thy life I share a part; 
 One word, O Lord, one word from Thee.
[v4]
 One word of pow’r, oh, let me hear,
 Above the heart’s most anxious fear,
 Thy still, small voice, yet deep and clear; 
 One word, O Lord, one word from Thee.
[v5]
 One word of final triumph, Lord;
 Sweet hope Thy promises afford,
 To dwell with Thee in sweet accord;
 One word, O Lord, one word from Thee.
