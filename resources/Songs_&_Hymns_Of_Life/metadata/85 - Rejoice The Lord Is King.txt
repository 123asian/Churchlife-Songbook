[v1]
 Rejoice, the Lord is King! 
 Your Lord and King adore! 
 Mortals, give thanks and sing, 
 And triumph evermore: 
 Lift up your heart, lift up your voice! 
 Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
[v2]
 His kingdom cannot fail, 
 He rules o’er earth and heav’n; 
 The keys of death and hell 
 Are to our Jesus giv’n: 
 Lift up your heart, lift up your voice! 
 Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
[v3]
 His kingdom cannot fail, 
 He rules o’er earth and heav’n; 
 The keys of death and hell 
 Are to our Jesus giv’n: 
 Lift up your heart, lift up your voice! 
 Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
[v4]
 He sits at God’s right hand 
 Till all His foes submit, 
 And bow to His command, 
 And fall beneath His feet: 
 Lift up your heart, lift up your voice! 
 Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
