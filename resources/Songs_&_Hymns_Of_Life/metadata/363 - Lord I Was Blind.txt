[v1]
 Lord, I was blind, I could not see 
 In Thy marred visage any grace; 
 But now the beauty of Thy face, 
 In radiant vision dawns on me.
[v2]
 Lord, I was deaf, I could not hear 
 The thrilling music of Thy voice; 
 But now I hear Thee and rejoice, 
 And all Thine uttered words are dear.
[v3]
 Lord, I was dumb, I could not speak 
 The grace and glory of Thy name; 
 But now, as touched with living flame, 
 My lips Thine eager praises wake.
[v4]
 Lord, I was dead, I could not stir
 My lifeless soul to come to Thee;
 But now, since Thou hast quickened me,
 I rise from sin’s dark sepulcher.
[v5]
 For Thou hast made the blind to see,
 The deaf to hear, the dumb to speak,
 The dead to live—and, lo! I break
 The chains of my captivity.
