[v1]
 O Word of God incarnate, 
 O Wisdom from on high, 
 O Truth unchanged, unchanging, 
 O Light of our dark sky, 
 We praise Thee for the radiance 
 That from the hallowed page, 
 A lantern to our footsteps, 
 Shines on from age to age.
[v2]
 The Church from You, our Savior 
 Received the gift divine, 
 And still that light she lifteth 
 O’er all the earth to shine: 
 It is a golden casket 
 Where gems of truth are stored; 
 It is the heav’n drawn picture 
 Of Christ, the living Word.
[v3]
 It floateth like a banner 
 Before God’s host unfurled; 
 It shineth like a beacon 
 Above the darkling world; 
 It is the chart and compass 
 That, o’er life’s surging sea, 
 ’Mid mists and rocks and quick-sands 
 Still guides, O Christ, to Thee.
[v4]
 O make Thy Church, dear Savior, 
 A lamp of burnished gold, 
 To bear before the nations 
 Thy true light, as of old; 
 O teach Thy wand’ring pilgrims 
 By this their path to trace, 
 Till, clouds and darkness ended, 
 They see Thee face to face.
