[v1]
 O soul, are you weary and troubled? 
 No light in the darkness you see? 
 There’s light for a look at the Savior  
 And life more abundant and free. 
[v2]
 Through death into life everlasting 
 He passed, and we follow Him there;
 O’er us sin no more hath dominion  
 For more than conq’rors we are!
[v3]
 His Word shall not fail you, He promised; 
 Believe Him and all will be well; 
 Then go to a world that is dying, 
 His perfect salvation to tell!
[c1]
 Turn your eyes upon Jesus, 
 Look full in His wonderful face,
 And the things of earth will grow strangely dim, 
 In the light of His glory and grace.
