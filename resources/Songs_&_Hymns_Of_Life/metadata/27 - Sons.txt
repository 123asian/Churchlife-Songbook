[v1]
 Father, Thy name our souls would bless, 
 As children taught by grace, 
 Lift up our hearts in righteousness,
 And joy before Thy face.
[v2]
 Sweet is the confidence Thou giv’st, 
 Though high above our praise; 
 Our hearts resort to where Thou liv’st 
 In heav’ns unclouded rays.
[v3]
 There in the purpose of Thy love, 
 Our place is now prepared, 
 As sons with Him who is above, 
 Who all our sorrows shared.
[v4]
 Eternal ages shall declare 
 The riches of Thy grace, 
 To those who with Thy Son shall share 
 A son’s eternal place.
[v5]
 Absent as yet, we rest in hope,
 Treading the desert path, 
 Waiting for Him who takes us up 
 Beyond the pow’r of death.
[v6]
 We joy in Thee, Thy holy love
 Our endless portion be,
 Like Thine own Son, with Him above,
 In brightest heav’nly bliss.
[v7]
 O Holy Father, keep us here
 In that blest name of love,
 Walking before Thee without fear,
 Till all be joy above.
