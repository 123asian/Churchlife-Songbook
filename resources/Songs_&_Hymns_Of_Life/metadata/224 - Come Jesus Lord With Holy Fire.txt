[v1]
 Come, Jesus Lord, with holy fire, 
 Come, and my quickened heart inspire, 
 My conscience purged by blood; 
 Now to my soul Thyself reveal, 
 Thy mighty working let me feel, 
 Since I am born of God.
[v2]
 Let nothing now my heart divide, 
 Since with Thee I am crucified, 
 And live to God in Thee. 
 Dead to the world and all its toys, 
 Its idle pomp and fading joys, 
 Jesus, my glory be.
[v3]
 Now with a quenchless thirst inspire, 
 A longing, infinite desire, 
 And fill my craving heart. 
 Less than Thyself, oh, do not give, 
 In might Thyself within me live; 
 Come, all Thou hast and art.
[v4]
 My will be swallowed up in Thee, 
 Light in Thy light still may I see 
 In Thine unclouded face: 
 Called the full strength of trust to prove, 
 Let all my quickened heart be love, 
 My spotless life be praise.
