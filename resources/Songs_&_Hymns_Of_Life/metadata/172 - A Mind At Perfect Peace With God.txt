[v1]
 A mind at perfect peace with God; 
 “O what a word is this!” 
 A sinner reconciled through blood; 
 This, this indeed is peace!
[v2]
 By nature and by practice far, 
 How very far from God! 
 Yet now by grace brought nigh to Him, 
 Through faith in Jesus’ blood.
[v3]
 So nigh, so very nigh to God, 
 I cannot nearer be; 
 For in the person of His Son, 
 I am as near as He.
[v4]
 So dear, so very dear to God,
 More dear I cannot be; 
 The love wherewith He loves the Son,
 Such is His love to me.
[v5]
 Why should I ever anxious be,
 Since such a God is mine?
 He watches o’er me night and day,
 And tells me “Mine is thine.”
