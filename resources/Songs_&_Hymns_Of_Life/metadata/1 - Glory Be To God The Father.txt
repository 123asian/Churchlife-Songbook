[v1]
 Glory be to God the Father, 
 Glory be to God the Son,
 Glory be to God the Spirit, 
 Great Jehovah, Three in One! 
 As it was, is now, and shall be 
 While the endless ages run.
[v2]
 Glory be to Him Who loved us, 
 Washed us from each spot and stain! 
 Glory be to Him Who bought us, 
 Made us kings with Him to reign! 
 Glory, glory, glory, glory 
 To the Lamb that once was slain!
[v3]
 Glory to the King of angels,
 Glory to the Church’s King, 
 Glory to the King of nations! 
 Heav’n and earth, your praises bring; 
 Glory, glory, glory, glory 
 To the King of glory bring!
[v4]
 “Glory, blessing, praise eternal!” 
 Thus the choir of angels sings; 
 “Honor, riches, pow’r, dominion!” 
 Thus its praise creation brings; 
 Glory, glory, glory, glory, 
 Glory to the King of kings!
