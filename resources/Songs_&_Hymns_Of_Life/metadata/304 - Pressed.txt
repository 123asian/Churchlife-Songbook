[v1]
 Pressed out of measure, pressed beyond all length; 
 Pressed so intensely, seeming beyond strength; 
 Pressed in the body, pressed within the soul, 
 Pressed in the mind till darksome surges roll. 
[v2]
 Pressure by foes, and pressure from our friends; 
 Pressure on pressure, till life nearly ends; 
 Pressed into knowing none to help but God, 
 Pressed into loving both the staff and rod.
[v3]
 Pressed into liberty where nothing clings, 
 Pressed into faith for hard and hopeless things; 
 Pressed into life, a life in Christ the Lord, 
 Pressed into life, the life of Christ outpoured.
[c1]
 God is my hope and God is my joy; 
 He is the resurrection life I enjoy.
