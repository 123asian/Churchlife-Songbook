[v1]
 I have a Savior, He’s pleading in glory, 
 A dear, loving Savior, though earth-friends be few; 
 And now He is watching in tenderness o’er me, 
 And, oh, that my Savior were your Savior too!
[v2]
 I have a Father; to me He has given 
 A hope for eternity, blessed and true; 
 And soon He will call me to meet Him in heaven, 
 But, oh, that He’d let me bring you with me too!
[v3]
 I have a peace; it is calm as a river, 
 A peace that the friends of this world never knew; 
 My Savior alone is its author and giver, 
 And, oh, could I know it was given for you!
[v4]
 When He has found you, tell others the story, 
 That my loving Savior is your Savior, too; 
 Then pray that your Savior may bring them to glory, 
 And prayer will be answered— ’twas answered for you!
[c1]
 For you I am praying, For you I am praying, 
 For you I am praying, I’m praying for you.
