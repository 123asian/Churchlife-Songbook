[v1]
 If the path I travel Lead me to the cross, 
 If the way Thou choosest 
 Lead to pain and loss, 
 Let the compensation 
 Daily, hourly, be 
 Shadowless communion, 
 Blessed Lord, with Thee.
[v2]
 If there’s less of earth joy, 
 Give, Lord, more of heav’n. 
 Let the spirit praise Thee, 
 Though the heart be riv’n; 
 If sweet earthly ties, Lord, 
 Break at Thy decree, 
 Let the tie that binds us, 
 Closer, sweeter, be.
[v3]
 Lonely though the pathway, 
 Cheer it with Thy smile; 
 Be Thou my companion 
 Through earth’s little while; 
 Selfless may I live, Lord, 
 By Thy grace to be 
 Just a cleansèd channel 
 For Thy life through me.
