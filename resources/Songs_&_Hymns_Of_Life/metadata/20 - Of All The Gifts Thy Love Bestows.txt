[v1]
 Of all the gifts Thy love bestows, 
 Thou Giver of all good! 
 E’en heav’n itself no richer knows 
 Than Jesus and His blood.
[v2]
 Faith, too, that trusts in Him through grace, 
 From that same love we gain; 
 Else, sweetly as it suits our case, 
 The gift had been in vain.
[v3]
 O Love divine, Thou vast abyss! 
 Our sins entombed in Thee, 
 And covered our unrighteousness, 
 From all debts we are free.
[v4]
 In Jesus’ blood our hearts can trace 
 The footprints of Thy love, 
 And know the riches of Thy grace, 
 The holy righteousness.
[v5]
 Though heart may fail and flesh decay,
 We grounded firm remain;
 When earth and heav’n shall pass away,
 Our anchor shall sustain.
[v6]
 Until that day, we all confirm,
 The virtue of Thy love.
 While here on earth, our utmost need,
 Thy great sustaining pow’r.
[v7]
 We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more,
 To Thee our all we owe:
 The precious Savior, and the pow’r
 t makes Him precious too.
