[v1]
 In nothing be anxious; the Lord is at hand. 
 In peace and in vict’ry triumphantly stand; 
 Let nothing affright thee and nothing dismay,
 For Jesus is coming! It may be today.
[v2]
 In nothing be anxious; on Him roll thy care. 
 Thy sins were laid on Him, thy sorrows He’ll bear; 
 Carefree and triumphant press on, still to prove 
 The strength of His arm and the balm of His love.
[v3]
 In nothing be anxious; should Jesus delay 
 His strength will be thine till the end of the day. 
 His arm thou canst lean on; His Spirit will cheer; 
 Then wherefore be anxious, press on without fear.
