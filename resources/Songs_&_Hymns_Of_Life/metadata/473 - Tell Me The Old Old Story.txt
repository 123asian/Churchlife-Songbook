[v1]
 Tell me the old, old story, 
 Of unseen things above, 
 Of Jesus and His glory, 
 Of Jesus and His love; 
 Tell me the story simply, 
 As to a little child, 
 For I am weak and weary, 
 And helpless and defiled. 
[v2]
 Tell me the story slowly, 
 That I may take it in— 
 That wonderful redemption, 
 God’s remedy for sin; 
 Tell me the story often, 
 For I forget so soon, 
 The early dew of morning 
 Has passed away at noon.
[v3]
 Tell me the story softly, 
 With earnest tones and grave; 
 Remember I’m the sinner 
 Whom Jesus came to save; 
 Tell me the story always, 
 If you would really be, 
 In any time of trouble, 
 A comforter to me.
[v4]
 Tell me the same old story, 
 When you have cause to fear 
 That this world’s empty glory 
 Is costing me too dear; 
 And when the Lord’s bright glory 
 Is dawning on my soul, 
 Tell me the old, old story: 
 “Christ Jesus makes thee whole.”
[c1]
 Tell me the old, old story, 
 Tell me the old, old story, 
 Tell me the old, old story, 
 Of Jesus and His love.
