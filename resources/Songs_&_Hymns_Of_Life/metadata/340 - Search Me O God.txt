[v1]
 Search me, O God, my actions try, 
 And let my life appear 
 As seen by Thine all-searching eye— 
 To mine my ways make clear.
[v2]
 Search all my sense, and know my heart 
 Who only canst make known, 
 And let the deep, the hidden part 
 To me be fully shown.
[v3]
 Throw light into the darkened cells, 
 Where passion reigns within; 
 Quicken my conscience till it feels 
 The loathsomeness of sin.
[v4]
 Search all my thoughts, the secret springs,
 The motives that control;
 The chambers where polluted things
 Hold empire o’er the soul.
[v5]
 Search, till Thy fiery glance has cast
 Its holy light through all,
 And I by grace am brought at last
 Before Thy face to fall.
[v6]
 Thus prostrate I shall learn of Thee,
 What now I feebly prove,
 That God alone in Christ can be
 Unutterable love.
