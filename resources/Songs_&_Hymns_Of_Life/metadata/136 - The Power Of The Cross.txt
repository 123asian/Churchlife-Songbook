[v1]
 Oh to see the dawn of the darkest day; 
 Christ on the road to Calvary. 
 Tried by sinful men, torn and beaten, then 
 nailed to a cross of wood. 
[v2]
 Oh to see the pain written on Your face, 
 bearing the awesome weight of sin. 
 Every bitter thought, every evil deed 
 crowning Your bloodstained brow.
[v3]
 Now the daylight flees; now the ground beneath 
 quakes as its Maker bows His  head. 
 Curtain torn in two, dead are raised to life— 
 “Finished!” the vict’ry cry.
[v4]
 Oh to see my name written in the wounds, 
 for through Your suff’ring I am free. 
 Death is crushed to death, life is mine to live, 
 won through Your selfless love! 
[c1]
 This the pow’r of the cross: 
 Christ became sin for us. 
 Took the blame, bore the wrath; 
 We stand forgiven at the cross.  
[c2]
 This the pow’r of the cross: 
 Son of God slain for us. 
 What a love, what a cost. 
 We stand forgiven at the cross.
