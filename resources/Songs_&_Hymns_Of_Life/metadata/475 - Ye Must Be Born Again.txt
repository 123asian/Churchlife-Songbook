[v1]
 A ruler once came to Jesus by night, 
 To ask Him the way of salvation and light; 
 The Master made answer in words true and plain, 
 “Ye must be born again!” 
[v2]
 Ye children of men, attuned to the word 
 So solemnly uttered by Jesus, the Lord, 
 And let not this message to you be in vain, 
 “Ye must be born again!”
[v3]
 Oh, ye who would enter that glorious rest, 
 And sing with the ransomed the song of the blest; 
 The life everlasting if ye would obtain, 
 “Ye must be born again!”
[c1]
 “Ye must be born again!” 
 “Ye must be born again!” 
 “I verily, verily say unto thee, 
 Ye must be born again!”
