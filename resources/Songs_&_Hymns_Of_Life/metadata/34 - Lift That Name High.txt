[v1]
 Lift that Name high! That glorious Name, 
 Let heav’n and earth its pow’r proclaim; 
 Our mighty conqu’ring, coming King, 
 Earth yet shall with His praises ring.
[v2]
 Lift that Name high! To that high tower 
 We flee in every trial hour, 
 Safe, sheltered, satisfied and free; 
 For Jesus’ Name is victory.
[v3]
 Lift that Name high! Until one day 
 His mighty Name the earth shall sway, 
 And sin and death, distress and pain 
 Shall be no more, for Christ shall reign.
[v4]
 Lift that Name high! Jesus shall reign, 
 And kings shall follow in His train; 
 Lift that Name high, all names above, 
 The Name of Him we own and love.
