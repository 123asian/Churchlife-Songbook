[v1]
 Oh, trust thyself to Jesus 
 When conscious of thy sin, 
 Its heavy weight upon thee, 
 Its mighty pow’r within: 
 Then is the hour for pleading 
 His finished work for thee: 
 Then is the time for singing, 
 His blood was shed for me.
[v2]
 Oh, trust thyself to Jesus 
 When tempted to transgress,
 By word or look of anger, 
 Or thought of bitterness: 
 Then is the hour for claiming 
 Thy Lord to fight for thee: 
 Then is the time for singing, 
 He doth deliver me.
[v3]
 Oh, trust thyself to Jesus 
 When daily cares perplex, 
 And trifles seem so mighty 
 Thy inner soul to vex: 
 Then is the hour for grasping 
 His hand who walked the sea: 
 Then is the time for singing, 
 He makes it calm for me.
[v4]
 Oh, trust thyself to Jesus 
 When thou art wearied sore, 
 When head or hand refuses 
 To think or labor more: 
 Then is the hour for leaning 
 Upon the Master’s breast: 
 Then is the time for singing, 
 My Savior gives me rest.
