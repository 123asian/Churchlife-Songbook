[v1]
 Come, Holy Spirit, Dove divine, 
 On these baptismal waters shine, 
 And teach our hearts, in highest strain, 
 To praise the Lamb for sinners slain.
[v2]
 We love Thy name, we love Thy laws, 
 And joyfully embrace Thy cause; 
 We love Thy cross, the shame, the pain, 
 O Lamb of God for sinners slain.
[v3]
 We sink beneath the waterâ€™s face, 
 And thank Thee for Thy saving grace; 
 We die to sin and seek a grave 
 With Thee, beneath the yielding wave.
[v4]
 And as we rise with Thee to live, 
 O let the Holy Spirit give 
 The sealing unction from above, 
 The joy of life, the fire of love.
