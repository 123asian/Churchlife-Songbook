[v1]
Thy sorrows, Savior, we retrace,
And tears of praise Thy griefs compel.
What love and grace illume Thy face
As Jesus, as Immanuel!

[v2]
Amid Thy loneliness below,
What scorn and outrage Thee befell:
Deep shame and woe, rude blow on blow,
Endured for us, Immanuel!

[v3]
But oh, what grief, what agony,
When wrathful judgment’s awful spell
Burst over Thee on Calv’ry’s tree,
God’s Lamb for us, Immanuel!

[v4]
Arisen radiant from the dead,
Thy sorrow’s scars forever tell,
Creation’s Head is He who bled—
Still Jesus, still Immanuel!

[v5]
E’en now from saints, in concord sweet,
Celestial strains of worship well;
For, O, ’tis meet glad songs should greet
Thy heart of love, Immanuel!

[v6]
But when Thy glorious face we see,
How shall the bursting paean swell!
Our souls shall be outpoured for Thee—
Outpoured for Thee, Immanuel!
