[v1]
 O, who’s like our Jesus? He’s all we desire! 
 His love draws us near, sets our spirits afire! 
 We cannot but love Him— as one we proclaim: 
 "Lord Jesus we love Thee— exalt Thy dear name!"
[v2]
 O Jesus, our Jesus, with Thee we are blest— 
 Our Life, our Enjoyment, our Peace and our Rest: 
 Thy name be our theme, and Thy love be our song; 
 Thy love has inspired both our heart and our tongue!
[v3]
 O Jesus, our Jesus, how can we express 
 Thy dearness, so precious, and Thy loveliness? 
 When we see Thy beauty, all else fades away— 
 All shadows must flee at the breaking of day!
[v4]
 We love Thee, we love Thee, we love Thee, O Lord. 
 We love Thee, our Jesus, we love Thee, our God! 
 We love Thee, we love Thee, and that Thou dost know; 
 As we’re in Thy presence, love for Thee will grow!
