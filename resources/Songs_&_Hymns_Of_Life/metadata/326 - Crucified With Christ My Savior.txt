[v1]
 Crucified with Christ my Savior, 
 To the world and self and sin; 
 To the deathborn life of Jesus 
 I am sweetly ent’ring in; 
 In His fellowship of suff’ring, 
 To His death conformed to be,
 I am going with my Savior 
 All the way to Calvary. 
[v2]
 ’Tis not hard to die with Christ 
 When His risen life we know; 
 ’Tis not hard to share His suff’rings 
 When our hearts with joy o’erflow. 
 In His resurrection power 
 He has come to dwell in me, 
 And my heart is gladly going 
 All the way to Calvary.
[v3]
 If we die we’ll live with Christ, 
 If we suffer we shall reign; 
 Only thus the prize of glory 
 Can the conqueror attain. 
 Oh, how sweet, on that glad morning 
 Should the Master say to thee, 
 “Yes, my child, thou didst go with me 
 All the way to Calvary.”
[c1]
 All the way to Calvary, 
 Where my Savior went for me, 
 Help me, Lord, to go with Thee, 
 All the way to Calvary.
