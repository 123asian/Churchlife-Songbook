[v1]
 Like a river glorious 
 Is Godâ€™s perfect peace, 
 Over all victorious 
 In its bright increase; 
 Perfect, yet it floweth 
 Fuller every day, 
 Perfect, yet it groweth 
 Deeper all the way. 
[v2]
 Hidden in the hollow 
 Of His blessed hand, 
 Never foe can follow,
 Never traitor stand; 
 Not a surge of worry, 
 Not a shade of care, 
 Not a blast of hurry 
 Touch the spirit there.
[v3]
 Every joy or trial 
 Falleth from above, 
 Traced upon our dial 
 By the Sun of Love. 
 We may trust Him fully 
 All for us to do; 
 They who trust Him wholly 
 Find Him wholly true.
[c1]
 Stayed upon Christ Jesus, 
 Hearts are fully blest; 
 Finding, as He promised, 
 Perfect peace and rest.
