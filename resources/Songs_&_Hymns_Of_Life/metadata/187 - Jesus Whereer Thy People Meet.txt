[v1]
 Jesus, where’er Thy people meet, 
 There they behold Thy mercy-seat; 
 Where’er they seek Thee, Thou art found, 
 And every place is hallowed ground.
[v2]
 For Thou, within no walls confined, 
 Inhabitest the humble mind; 
 Such ever bring Thee where they come, 
 And going, take Thee to their home.
[v3]
 Dear Shepherd of Thy chosen few, 
 Thy former mercies here renew; 
 Here, to our waiting hearts, proclaim 
 The sweetness of Thy saving name.
[v4]
 Here may we prove the pow’r of prayer 
 To strengthen faith and sweeten care; 
 To teach our faint desires to rise, 
 And bring all heav’n before our eyes.
[v5]
 Lord, we are few, but Thou art near; 
 Nor short Thine arm, nor deaf Thine ear; 
 Oh, rend the heav’ns, come quickly down, 
 And make our waiting hearts Thine own.
[v6]
 Command Thy blessing in this hour;
 And as the Spirit full of pow’r
 With life and vision fill this place,
 That all Thy purpose we may trace.
[v7]
 O Thou, our Head, our Life, our Guide,
 May nought in life or death divide
 The saints in Thy communion blessed,
 That all Thy fulness be expressed.
