[v1]
 God be with you till we meet again; 
 By His counsels guide, uphold you, 
 With His sheep in love enfold you: 
 God be with you till we meet again. 
[v2]
 God be with you till we meet again; 
 ’Neath His wings protecting hide you, 
 Daily manna still provide you: 
 God be with you till we meet again. 
[v3]
 God be with you till we meet again; 
 When life’s perils thick confound you, 
 Put His arms unfailing round you: 
 God be with you till we meet again. 
[v4]
 God be with you till we meet again; 
 Keep love’s banner floating o’er you, 
 Smite death’s threat’ning wave before you: 
 God be with you till we meet again. 
[c1]
 Till we meet, till we meet, 
 Till we meet at Jesus’ feet; 
 Till we meet, till we meet, 
 God be with you till we meet again.
