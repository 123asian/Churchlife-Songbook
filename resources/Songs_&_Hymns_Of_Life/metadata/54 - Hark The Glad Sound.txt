[v1]
 Hark, the glad sound! the Savior comes, 
 The Savior promised long; 
 Let every heart prepare a throne,
 And every voice a song.
[v2]
 He comes the pris’ners to release 
 In Satan’s bondage held; 
 The gates of brass before Him burst, 
 The iron fetters yield.
[v3]
 He comes, from dark’ning scales of vice, 
 To clear the inward sight,
 And on the eyes oppressed with night 
 To pour celestial light.
[v4]
 He comes the broken heart to bind,
 The bleeding soul to cure;
 And with the treasures of His grace
 To bless the humble poor.
[v5]
 Our glad Hosannas, Prince of Peace,
 Thy welcome shall proclaim;
 And heav’n’s exalted arches ring
 With Thy belovéd Name.
