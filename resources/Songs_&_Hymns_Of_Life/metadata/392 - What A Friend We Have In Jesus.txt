[v1]
 What a Friend we have in Jesus, 
 All our sins and griefs to bear! 
 What a privilege to carry 
 Everything to God in prayer! 
 O what peace we often forfeit, 
 O what needless pain we bear, 
 All because we do not carry 
 Everything to God in prayer!
[v2]
 Have we trials and temptations? 
 Is there trouble anywhere? 
 We should never be discouraged, 
 Take it to the Lord in prayer. 
 Can we find a friend so faithful 
 Who will all our sorrows share? 
 Jesus knows our every weakness, 
 Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[v3]
 Are we weak and heavy-laden, 
 Cumbered with a load of care? 
 Precious Savior, still our Refuge—  
 Take it to the Lord in prayer. 
 Do thy friends despise, forsake thee? 
 Take it to the Lord in prayer; 
 In His arms He’ll take and shield thee, 
 Thou wilt find a solace there.
[v4]
 Blessed Savior, Thou hast promised 
 Thou wilt all our burdens bear; 
 May we ever, Lord, be bringing 
 All to Thee in earnest prayer. 
 Soon in glory bright unclouded 
 There will be no need for prayer; 
 Rapture, praise, and endless worship 
 Will be our sweet portion there.
