[v1]
 “Man of Sorrows,” what a name 
 For the Son of God who came 
 Ruined sinners to reclaim!
 Hallelujah! What a Savior!
[v2]
 Bearing shame and scoffing rude, 
 In my place condemned He stood; 
 Sealed my pardon with His blood; 
 Hallelujah! What a Savior!
[v3]
 Guilty, vile, and helpless, we, 
 Spotless Lamb of God was He; 
 Full redemption— can it be?
 Hallelujah! What a Savior!
[v4]
 Lifted up was He to die,
 “It is finished!” was His cry;
 Now in heaven exalted high;
 Hallelujah! What a Savior!
[v5]
 When He comes, our glorious King,
 To His kingdom us to bring,
 Then anew this song we’ll sing:
 Hallelujah! What a Savior!
