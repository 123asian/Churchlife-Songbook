[v1]
 Pass me not, O gentle Savior, 
 Hear my humble cry; 
 While on others Thou art calling, 
 Do not pass me by. 
[v2]
 Let me at Thy throne of mercy 
 Find a sweet relief; 
 Kneeling there in deep contrition, 
 Help my unbelief.
[v3]
 Trusting only in Thy merit, 
 Would I seek Thy face; 
 Heal my wounded, broken spirit, 
 Save me by Thy grace.
[v4]
 Thou the Spring of all my comfort, 
 More than life to me; 
 Whom have I on earth beside Thee? 
 Whom in heavâ€™n but Thee?
[c1]
 Savior, Savior, 
 Hear my humble cry; 
 While on others Thou art calling, 
 Do not pass me by.
