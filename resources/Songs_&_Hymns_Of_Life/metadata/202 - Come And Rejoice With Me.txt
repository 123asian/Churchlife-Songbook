[v1]
 Come and rejoice with me! 
 For once my heart was poor, 
 And I have found a treasury 
 Of love, a boundless store.
[v2]
 Come and rejoice with me! 
 I, once so sick at heart, 
 Have met with One who knows my case, 
 And knows the healing art.
[v3]
 Come and rejoice with me! 
 For I was wearied sore, 
 And I have found a mighty arm 
 Which holds me evermore.
[v4]
 Come and rejoice with me!
 My feet so wide did roam,
 And One has brought me from afar,
 To find in Him my home.
[v5]
 Come and rejoice with me!
 For I have found a Friend
 Who knows my heartâ€™s most secret depths,
 Yet loves me without end.
[v6]
 I knew not of His love,
 And He had loved so long,
 With love so faithful and so deep,
 So tender and so strong.
[v7]
 And now I know it all,
 Have heard and known His voice
 And hear it still from day to day.
 Can I enough rejoice?
