[v1]
 O for a thousand tongues to sing 
 My great Redeemer’s praise, 
 The glories of my God and King, 
 The triumphs of His grace.
[v2]
 My gracious Master and my God, 
 Assist me to proclaim, 
 To spread through all the earth abroad 
 The honors of Thy name.
[v3]
 Jesus! the name that charms our fears, 
 That bids our sorrows cease;
 ’Tis music in the sinner’s ears, 
 ’Tis life, and health, and peace.
[v4]
 Jesus! the name that charms our fears, 
 That bids our sorrows cease; 
 ’Tis music in the sinner’s ears, 
 ’Tis life, and health, and peace.
