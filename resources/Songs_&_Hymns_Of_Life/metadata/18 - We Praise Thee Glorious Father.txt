[v1]
 We praise Thee, glorious Father, 
 As objects of Thy grace, 
 Who for Thine own heart’s pleasure 
 Are now before Thy face: 
 Thy sons marked out for glory 
 Known from eternity— 
 With Christ Thy Well-beloved, 
 Object supreme to Thee.
[v2]
 Who else but Thee, O Father, 
 Could in Thine only Son 
 So bless us with Thy Spirit, 
 And have us for Thine own? 
 Soon shall we be forever 
 With Christ in glory; then 
 We'll shine in His blest image 
 Eternally, Amen!
