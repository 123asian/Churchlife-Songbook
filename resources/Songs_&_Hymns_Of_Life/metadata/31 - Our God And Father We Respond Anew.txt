[v1]
 Our God and Father, we respond anew 
 To love in Christ revealed, and praise Thy name. 
 He did Thy will; and for the joy in view, 
 Endured the cross, despising all the shame.
[v2]
 He, midst His brethren, strikes the note of praise; 
 We hear His song, our hearts responsive swell; 
 And on this day when He His voice doth raise, 
 In spirit we do join and praise Thee well.
[v3]
 Chosen in Him, Thy well-beloved Son, 
 We have our part in joy before Thy face; 
 Predestined, ere this world had yet begun, 
 For that blest world, where all bespeaks Thy grace.
[v4]
 Sons loved and loving, whom Thy Spirit fills, 
 Our endless portion Christ in us to be; 
 Each with some trait of Him whose love us thrills, 
 For Thy delight and joy eternally.
