[v1]
 I come to the garden alone, 
 While the dew is still on the roses; 
 And the voice I hear falling on my ear, 
 The Son of God discloses. 
[v2]
 He speaks, and the sound of His voice 
 Is so sweet the birds hush their singing; 
 And the melody that He gave to me 
 Within my heart is ringing.
[v3]
 I’d stay in the garden with Him 
 Though the night around me be falling; 
 But He bids me go, thro’ the voice of woe; 
 His voice to me is calling.
[c1]
 And He walks with me and He talks with me, 
 And He tells me I am His own; 
 And the joy we share as we tarry there, 
 None other has ever known.
