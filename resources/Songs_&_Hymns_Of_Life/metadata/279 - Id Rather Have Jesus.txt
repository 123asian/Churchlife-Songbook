[v1]
 I’d rather have Jesus than silver or gold; 
 I’d rather be His than have riches untold; 
 I’d rather have Jesus than houses or lands.
 I’d rather be led by His nail-pierced hand. 
[v2]
 I’d rather have Jesus than men’s applause; 
 I’d rather be faithful to His dear cause; 
 I’d rather have Jesus than worldwide fame.
 I’d rather be true to His holy name.
[v3]
 He’s fairer than lilies of rarest bloom; 
 He’s sweeter than honey from out the comb; 
 He’s all that my hungering spirit needs.
 I’d rather have Jesus and let Him lead.
[c1]
 Than to be the king of a vast domain 
 And be held in sin’s dread sway. 
 I’d rather have Jesus than anything 
 This world affords today.
