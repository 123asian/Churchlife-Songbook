[v1]
 I know not why God’s wondrous grace 
 To me He hath made known, 
 Nor why— unworthy— Christ in love 
 Redeemed me for His own. 
[v2]
 I know not how this saving faith 
 To me He did impart, 
 Nor how believing in His Word 
 Wrought peace within my heart.
[v3]
 I know not how the Spirit moves, 
 Convincing men of sin, 
 Revealing Jesus through the Word, 
 Creating faith in Him.
[v4]
 I know not what of good or ill
 May be reserved for me,
 Of weary ways or golden days,
 Before His face I see.
       
[v5]
 I know not when my Lord may come,
 At night or noonday fair,
 Nor if I’ll walk the vale with Him,
 Or meet Him in the air.
[c1]
 But “I know Whom I have believed 
 And am persuaded that He is able 
 To keep that which I’ve committed 
 Unto Him against that day.”
