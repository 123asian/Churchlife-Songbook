[v1]
 Father, Thy Son beloved leads our praise 
 After the banquet feast is had and done; 
 How dear, how sweet to Thee the praise He leads, 
 And in His praises joining we are one.
[v2]
 Father, we need no goodness more than Thee, 
 Nor do we seek a love thatâ€™s less than Thine; 
 How we adore Thee now that here we know 
 Thy searchless, uncreated life divine.
[v3]
 Father, within Thy love our love to Thee 
 Grows, far transcending all our earthly ties; 
 Thine own dear love in power leads our hearts 
 Where Thine own presence deeply satisfies.
[v4]
 Father, by joining with Thy Son beloved, 
 We all with gladness praise Thee now again; 
 Joyfully feasting on Thy holy love, 
 Tasting, as sons, the sweetness of Thy name.
