[v1]
 “Abba, Father,” we approach Thee 
 In our Savior’s precious name. 
 We, Thy children, here assembling, 
 Now the promised blessing claim. 
 From our sins His blood has washed us, 
 ’Tis thro’ Him our souls draw nigh; 
 And Thy Spirit too has taught us, 
 “Abba, Father!” thus to cry.
[v2]
 Once as prodigals we wandered 
 In our folly far from Thee; 
 But Thy grace, o’er sin abounding, 
 Rescued us from misery. 
 Thou thy prodigals hast pardoned, 
 “Kissed us” with a Father’s love; 
 “Killed the fatted calf,” and called us 
 E’er to dwell with Thee above.
[v3]
 Clothed in garments of salvation, 
 At Thy table is our place; 
 We rejoice, and Thou rejoicest, 
 In the riches of Thy grace. 
 “It is meet,” we hear Thee saying, 
 “We should merry be and glad; 
 I have found My once lost children, 
 Now they live, who once were dead.”
[v4]
 “Abba, Father!” all adore Thee, 
 All rejoice in heav’n above; 
 While in us they learn the wonders 
 Of Thy wisdom, grace, and love. 
 Soon before Thy throne assembled, 
 All Thy children shall proclaim 
 “Glory, everlasting glory,
 Be to God and to the Lamb!”
