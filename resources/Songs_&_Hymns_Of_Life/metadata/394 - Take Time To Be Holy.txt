[v1]
 Take time to be holy, 
 Speak oft with your Lord,     
 Abide in Him always, 
 And feed on His Word. 
 Make friends with Godâ€™s children, 
 Help those who are weak, 
 Forgetting in nothing 
 His blessing to seek.
[v2]
 Take time to be holy, 
 The world rushes on; 
 Spend much time in secret 
 With Jesus alone.   
 By looking to Jesus 
 Like Him you shall be; 
 Your friends, in your conduct, 
 His likeness shall see.
[v3]
 Take time to be holy, 
 Let Him be your Guide;   
 And run not before Him 
 Whatever betide;   
 In joy or in sorrow 
 Still follow the Lord, 
 And, looking to Jesus, 
 Still trust in His Word.
[v4]
 Take time to be holy, 
 Be calm in your soul,  
 Each thought and each motive 
 Beneath His control. 
 Thus led by His Spirit 
 To fountains of love, 
 You then shall be fitted 
 For service above.
