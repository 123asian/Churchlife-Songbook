[v1]
 Down from His glory,   
 Ever living story, 
 My God and Savior came, 
 And Jesus was His name.  
 Born in a manger, 
 To His own a stranger, 
 A Man of sorrows, tears and agony. 
[v2]
 What condescension, 
 Bringing us redemption; 
 That in the dead of night, 
 Not one faint hope in sight, 
 God, gracious, tender, 
 Laid aside His splendor, 
 Stooping to woo, to win, to save my soul.
[v3]
 Without reluctance, 
 Flesh and blood His substance, 
 He took the form of man, 
 Revealed the hidden plan. 
 O glorious myst’ry,  
 Sacrifice of Calv’ry, 
 And now I know Thou art the great “I AM.”
[c1]
 O how I love Him! 
 How I adore Him! 
 My breath, my sunshine, my all in all! 
 The great Creator 
 Became my Savior, 
 And all God’s fullness dwelleth in Him.
