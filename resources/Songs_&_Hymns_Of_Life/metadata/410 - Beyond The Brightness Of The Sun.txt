[v1]
 Marvel not that Christ in glory 
 All my inmost heart hath won; 
 Not a star to cheer my darkness, 
 But a light beyond the sun. 
 All below lies dark and shadowed, 
 Nothing here to claim my heart, 
 Save the lonely track of sorrow 
 Where of old He walked apart.
[v2]
 Others in the summer sunshine 
 Wearily may journey on, 
 I have seen a light from heaven 
 Past the brightness of the sun— 
 Light that knows no cloud, no waning, 
 Light wherein I see His face, 
 All His love’s uncounted treasures, 
 All the riches of His grace:
[v3]
 All the wonders of His glory, 
 Deeper wonders of His love— 
 How for me He won, He keepeth 
 That high place in heav’n above; 
 Not a glimpse— the veil uplifted— 
 But within the veil to dwell, 
 Gazing on His face forever, 
 Hearing words unspeakable.
[v4]
 I have seen the face of Jesus— 
 Tell me not of aught beside; 
 I have heard the voice of Jesus— 
 All my soul is satisfied. 
 In the radiance of the glory
 First I saw His blessed face, 
 And forever shall that glory 
 Be my home, my dwelling place.
