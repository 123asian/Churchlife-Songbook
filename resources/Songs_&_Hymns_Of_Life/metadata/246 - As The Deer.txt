[V1]
 As the deer panteth for the water, 
 so my soul longeth after You. 
 You alone are my heart’s desire 
 and I long to worship You.
[V2]
 You’re my friend and You are my brother 
 even though You are a King. 
 I love You more than any other, 
 so much more than anything. 
[V3]
 I want You more than gold or silver, 
 only You  can satisfy.  
 You alone are the real joy giver 
 and the apple of my eye.
[C1]
 You alone are my strength, my shield; 
 To You alone may my spirit yield. 
 You alone are my heart`s desire and I long to worship You.
