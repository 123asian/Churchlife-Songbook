[v1]
 Be not dismayed whate’er betide, 
 God will take care of you! 
 Beneath His wings of love abide, 
 God will take care of you! 
[v2]
 Through days of toil when heart does fail, 
 God will take care of you! 
 When dangers fierce your path assail, 
 God will take care of you!
[v3]
 All you may need He will provide, 
 God will take care of you!
 Trust Him, and you will be satisfied, 
 God will take care of you!
[v4]
 Lonely and sad, from friends apart, 
 God will take care of you! 
 He will give peace to your aching heart, 
 God will take care of you!
[v5]
 No matter what may be the test,
 God will take care of you!
 Lean, weary one, upon His breast,
 God will take care of you!
[c1]
 God will take care of you, 
 Through every day o’er all the way;
 He will take care of you; 
 God will take care of you!
