[v1]
 I need Thee every hour, 
 Most gracious Lord; 
 No tender voice like Thine 
 Can peace afford. 
[v2]
 I need Thee every hour, 
 Stay Thou near by; 
 Temptations lose their pow’r 
 When Thou art nigh.
[v3]
 I need Thee every hour, 
 In joy or pain; 
 Come quickly and abide, 
 Or life is vain.
[v4]
 I need Thee every hour,
 Teach me Thy will;
 And Thy rich promises
 In me fulfill.
[v5]
 I need Thee every hour,
 Most Holy One;
 Oh, make me Thine indeed,
 Thou blesséd Son.
[c1]
 I need Thee, Oh, I need Thee; 
 Every hour I need Thee; 
 Oh, bless me now, my Savior! 
 I come to Thee.
