[v1]
 I dare not be defeated 
 With Calvary in view, 
 Where Jesus conquered Satan, 
 Where all His foes He slew;
 Come, Lord, and give the vision 
 To nerve me for the fight, 
 Make me an overcomer 
 Clothed with Thy Spirit’s might. 
[v2]
 I dare not be defeated 
 Since Christ, my conqu’ring King 
 Has called me to the battle 
 Which He did surely win. 
 Come, Lord, and give me courage, 
 Thy conqu’ring Spirit give, 
 Make me an overcomer, 
 In pow’r within me live.
[v3]
 I dare not be defeated, 
 When Jesus leads me on 
 To press through hellish regions 
 To share with Him His Throne; 
 Come, Lord, and give Thy soldier 
 The pow’r to wield the sword, 
 Make me an overcomer 
 Through Thine inerrant Word.
[v4]
 I dare not be defeated, 
 Just at the set of sun, 
 When Jesus waits to whisper, 
 “Well done, beloved, well done;” 
 Come, Lord, bend from the Glory, 
 On me Thy Spirit cast, 
 Make me an overcomer, 
 A victor to the last.
[c1]
 A victor, a victor!  
 Because of Calvary. 
 Make me an overcomer, 
 A conqu’ror, 
 A conqu’ror, Lord, in Thee.
