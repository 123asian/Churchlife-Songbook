[v1]
 Savior, I by faith am touching 
 Thee, the source of every good; 
 Virtue now, by faith am claiming, 
 Through the cleansing of Thy blood. 
[v2]
 Touching Thee in faith, I take Thee 
 In Thy riches full and free; 
 All I am I open to Thee, 
 All Thou art Thou giv’st to me.
[v3]
 Touching now Thine outstretched scepter, 
 O most mighty King of kings; 
 Of Thy fulness now receiving, 
 High I mount on eagle wings.
[v4]
 Grace and virtue, strength and wisdom, 
 All my need, by Thee supplied; 
 Keep me touching, keep me claiming, 
 Keep me ever at Thy side.
[c1]
 Touching Thee, new life is glowing 
 By Thy Spirit’s burning flame; 
 Cleansing, purging, Spirit-filling, 
 Glory to Thy Holy Name!
