[v1]
 King of my life, I crown Thee now, 
 Thine shall the glory be; 
 Lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned brow, 
 Lead me to Calvary. 
[v2]
 Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid, 
 Tenderly mourned and wept; 
 Angels in robes of light arrayed 
 Guarded Thee while Thou slept.
[v3]
 Let me like Mary, through the gloom, 
 Come with a gift to Thee; 
 Show to me now the empty tomb, 
 Lead me to Calvary.
[v4]
 May I be willing, Lord, to bear
 Daily my cross for Thee;
 Even Thy cup of grief to share,
 Thou hast borne all for me.
[v5]
 Fill me, O Lord, with Thy desire
 For all that know not Thee;
 Then touch my lips with holy fire,
 To speak of Calvary.
[c1]
 Lest I forget Gethsemane, 
 Lest I forget Thine agony; 
 Lest I forget Thy love for me, 
 Lead me to Calvary.
