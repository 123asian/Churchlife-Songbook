[v1]
 He died for me that I might live; 
 I live for Him who died, 
 My life, my love to Him I give— 
 Jesus, the Crucified. 
[v2]
 He died for me that I might die 
 To Satan, self, and sin; 
 O death so deep! O life so high! 
 Help me to enter in.
[v3]
 He lives for me that I may live 
 As spotless e’en as He; 
 Savior, to me Thy nature give, 
 And live Thy life in me.
[v4]
 He lives for me that I may give 
 His love to hearts that pine; 
 Let me like Him for others live, 
 And trace His steps divine.
[c1]
 O Jesus, my Lord and Savior, 
 Help me to fully follow Thee 
 In life and death and loving service, 
 As Thou hast lived and died for me.
