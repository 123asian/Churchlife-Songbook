[v1]
 Oh, now I see the cleansing wave! 
 The fountain deep and wide; 
 Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save, 
 Points to His wounded side. 
[v2]
 I see the dear Redeemer raised, 
 I hear the speaking blood; 
 It speaks! My spirit is amazed! 
 And quickened by its flood.
[v3]
 I rise to walk in Godâ€™s own light 
 Above the world and sin, 
 With heart renewed and garments white 
 And Christ enthroned within.
[c1]
 The cleansing stream I see, I see; 
 I plunge, and oh, it cleanses me! 
 Oh, praise the Lord, it cleanses me! 
 It cleanses me, yes, cleanses me!
