[v1]
 O come, all ye faithful, 
 Joyful and triumphant,
 O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem; 
 Come and behold Him, 
 Born the King of angels; 
[v2]
 True God of true God, 
 Light of light eternal,
 Our lowly nature He hath not abhorred; 
 Son of the Father, 
 Begotten, not created;
[v3]
 Sing, choirs of angels, 
 Sing in exultation; 
 Sing, all ye citizens of heav’n above; 
 Glory to God – 
 In the highest;
[v4]
 Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, 
 Born this happy morning, 
 Jesus, to Thee be all glory giv’n; 
 Word of the Father, 
 Now in flesh appearing;
[c1]
 O come, let us adore Him, 
 O come, let us adore Him, 
 O come, let us adore Him, 
 Christ the Lord.
