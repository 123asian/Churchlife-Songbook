[v1]
 The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want; 
 He makes me down to lie 
 In pastures green; He leadeth me 
 The quiet waters by.
[v2]
 My soul He doth restore again, 
 And me to walk doth make 
 Within the paths of righteousness, 
 E’en for His own name’s sake.
[v3]
 Yea, though I walk in death’s dark vale, 
 Yet will I fear no ill; 
 For Thou art with me, and Thy rod 
 And staff me comfort still.
[v4]
 My table Thou hast furnished
 In presence of my foes;
 My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
 And my cup overflows.
[v5]
 Goodness and mercy all my life
 Shall surely follow me,
 And in God’s house forevermore
 My dwelling-place shall be.
