[v1]
 “Within the Veil:” be this, beloved, thy portion, 
 Within the secret of thy Lord to dwell; 
 Beholding Him, until thy face His glory, 
 Thy life His love, thy lips His praise shall tell.
[v2]
 “Within the Veil,” for only as thou gazest 
 Upon the matchless beauty of His face, 
 Canst thou become a living revelation 
 Of His great heart of love, His untold grace.
[v3]
 “Within the Veil,” His fragrance poured upon thee, 
 Without the Veil, that fragrance shed abroad; 
 “Within the Veil,” His hand shall tune the music 
 Which sounds on earth the praises of Thy Lord.
[v4]
 “Within the Veil,” thy spirit deeply anchored, 
 Thou walkest calm above a world of strife; 
 “Within the Veil,” thy soul with Him united, 
 Shall live on earth His resurrection life.
