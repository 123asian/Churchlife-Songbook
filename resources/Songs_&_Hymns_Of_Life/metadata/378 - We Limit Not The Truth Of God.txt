[v1]
 We limit not the truth of God 
 To our poor reach of mind, 
 By notions of our day and sect, 
 Crude, partial, and confined. 
 Now let a new and better hope 
 Within our hearts be stirred: 
 The Lord has yet more light and truth 
 To break forth from His Word.
[v2]
 Who dares to bind by his dull sense 
 The oracles of heav’n, 
 For all the nations, tongues and climes 
 And all the ages given! 
 The universe how much unknown! 
 That ocean unexplored! 
 The Lord has yet more light and truth 
 To break forth from His Word.
[v3]
 Darkling our great forefathers went 
 The first steps of the way; 
 ’Twas but the dawning yet to grow 
 Into the perfect day; 
 And grow it shall, our glorious Sun 
 More fervid rays afford: 
 The Lord has yet more light and truth 
 To break forth from His Word.
[v4]
 The valleys past, ascending still,
 Our souls would higher climb,
 And look down from supernal heights,
 On all the bygone times;
 Upward we press, the air is clear,
 And the sphere-music heard!
 The Lord has yet more light and truth
 To break forth from His Word.
[v5]
 O Father, Son, and Spirit, send 
 Us increase from above;
 Enlarge, expand all Christian hearts
 To comprehend Thy love;
 And make us all go on to know
 With nobler powers conferred:
 The Lord has yet more light and truth
 To break forth from His Word.
