[v1]
 My glorious Victor, Prince Divine, 
 Clasp these surrendered hands in Thine; 
 At length my will is all Thine own, 
 Glad vassal of a Savior’s throne.
[v2]
 My Master, lead me to Thy door; 
 Pierce this now willing ear once more; 
 Thy bonds are freedom; let me stay 
 With Thee, to toil, endure, obey.
[v3]
 Yes, ear and hand, and thought and will, 
 Use all in Thy dear slav’ry still! 
 Self’s weary liberties I cast 
 Beneath Thy feet; there keep them fast.
[v4]
 Tread them still down; and then I know, 
 These hands shall with Thy gifts o’erflow; 
 And pierced ears shall hear the tone 
 Which tells me Thou and I are one.
