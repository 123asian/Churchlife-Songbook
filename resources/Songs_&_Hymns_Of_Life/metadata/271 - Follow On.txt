[v1]
 Down in the valley with my Savior I would go, 
 Where the flowâ€™rs are blooming and the sweet waters flow; 
 Everywhere He leads me I would follow, follow on. 
 Walking in His footsteps till the crown be won. 
[v2]
 Down in the valley with my Savior I would go, 
 Where the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flow; 
 With His hand to lead me I will never, never fear, 
 Danger cannot fright me if my Lord is near.
[v3]
 Down in the valley, or upon the mountain steep, 
 Close beside my Savior would my heart ever keep; 
 He will lead me safely in the path that He has trod, 
 Up to where they gather in the rest of God.
[c1]
 Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus! 
 Anywhere everywhere, I would follow on! 
 Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus! 
 Everywhere He leads me I would follow on!
