[v1]
 Jesus is tenderly calling you homeâ€” 
 Calling today, calling today! 
 Why from the sunshine of love will you roam, 
 Farther and farther away? 
[v2]
 Jesus is calling the weary to rest, 
 Calling today! calling today! 
 Bring Him your burden and you shall be blest: 
 He will not turn you away.
[v3]
 Jesus is waiting, O come to Him now! 
 Waiting today! waiting today! 
 Come with your sins, at His feet lowly bow; 
 Come, and no longer delay.
[v4]
 Jesus is pleading, O list to His voice! 
 Hear Him today! hear Him today! 
 They who believe on His name shall rejoice: 
 Quickly arise, come away!
[c1]
 Calling today! Calling today! 
 Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today!
