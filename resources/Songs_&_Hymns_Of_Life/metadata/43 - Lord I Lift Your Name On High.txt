[v1]
 Lord, I lift Your name on high; 
 Lord, I love to sing Your praises.
 I’m so glad You’re in my life; 
 I’m so glad You came to save us. 
 You came from heaven to earth to show the way, 
 from the earth to the cross my debt to pay;   
 From the cross to the grave, 
 from the grave to the sky; 
 Lord, I lift Your name on high.
