[v1]
 I must tell Jesus all of my trials; 
 I cannot bear these burdens alone; 
 In my distress He kindly will help me; 
 He ever loves and cares for His own. 
[v2]
 I must tell Jesus all of my troubles; 
 He is a kind, compassionate Friend; 
 If I but ask Him, He will deliver, 
 Make of my troubles quickly an end.
[v3]
 Tempted and tried I need a great Savior, 
 One who can help my burdens to bear; 
 I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus; 
 He all my cares and sorrows will share.
[v4]
 O how the world to evil allures me! 
 O how my heart is tempted to sin! 
 I must tell Jesus; and He will help me 
 Over the world the victâ€™ry to win.
[c1]
 I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus! 
 I cannot bear my burdens alone; 
 I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus! 
 Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.
