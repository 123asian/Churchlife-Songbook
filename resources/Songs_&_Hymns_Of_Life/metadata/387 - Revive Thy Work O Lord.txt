[v1]
 Revive Thy work, O Lord! 
 Now to Thy saints appear! 
 Oh, speak with powâ€™r to every soul, 
 And let Thy people hear! 
[v2]
 Revive Thy work, O Lord! 
 And every soul inspire; 
 Oh, kindle in each heart, we pray, 
 The Pentecostal fire!
[v3]
 Revive Thy work, O Lord! 
 Exalt Thy precious name! 
 And may Thy love in every heart 
 Be kindled to a flame!
[v4]
 Revive Thy work, O Lord! 
 And bless to all Thy Word! 
 And may its pure and sacred truth 
 In living faith be heard!
[v5]
 Revive Thy work, O Lord!
 And make Thy servants bold;
 Convict of sin and work once more
 As in the days of old.
[v6]
 Revive Thy work, O Lord!
 Give Pentecostal showers!
 Be Thine the glory, Thine alone!
 The blessing, Lord, be ours!
[c1]
 Revive Thy work, O Lord! 
 While here to Thee we bow; 
 Descend, O gracious Lord, descend! 
 Oh, come, and bless us now!
