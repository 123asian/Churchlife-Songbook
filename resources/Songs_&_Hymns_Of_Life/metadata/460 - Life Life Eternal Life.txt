[v1]
 Under the burdens of guilt and care, 
 Many a spirit is grieving, 
 Who in the joy of the Lord might share, 
 Life everlasting receiving. 
[v2]
 Burdened one, why will you longer bear 
 Sorrows from which He releases? 
 Open your heart, and rejoicing, share 
 Life more abundant in Jesus.
[v3]
 Leaving the mountain, the streamlet grows, 
 Flooding the vale with a river;    
 So, from the hill of the Cross, there flows 
 Life more abundant forever.
[v4]
 Oh, for the flood on the thirsty land! 
 Oh, for a mighty revival!  
 Oh, for a sanctified, fearless band, 
 Ready to hail its arrival!
[c1]
 Life! Life! Eternal life! 
 Jesus alone is the Giver: 
 Life! life! Abundant life! 
 Glory to Jesus forever!
