[v1]
 Like the woman at the well I was seeking 
 For things that could not satisfy; 
 And then I heard my Savior speaking:  
 “Draw from My well that never shall run dry.” 
[v2]
 There are millions in this world who are craving 
 The pleasure earthly things afford; 
 But none can match the wondrous treasure 
 That I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.
[v3]
 So, my brother, if the things this world gave you 
 Leave hungers that won’t pass away, 
 My blessed Lord will come and save you, 
 If you kneel to Him and humbly pray:
[c1]
 Fill my cup, Lord, I lift it up, Lord! 
 Come and quench this thirsting of my soul; 
 Bread of heaven, feed me ’til I want no more— 
 Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!
