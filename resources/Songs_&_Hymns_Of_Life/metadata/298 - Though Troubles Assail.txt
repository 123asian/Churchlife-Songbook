[v1]
 Though troubles assail, 
 And dangers affright; 
 Though friends should all fail, 
 And foes all unite, 
 Yet one thing secures us, 
 Whatever betide: 
 The Scripture assures us, 
 “The Lord will provide.”
[v2]
 The birds, without barn 
 Or storehouse, are fed; 
 From them let us learn 
 To trust for our bread; 
 His saints what is fitting 
 Shall ne’er be denied, 
 So long as ’tis written, 
 “The Lord will provide.”
[v3]
 His call we obey,
 Like Abram of old, 
 Not knowing our way, 
 But faith makes us bold; 
 For though we are strangers, 
 We have a good Guide; 
 And trust in all dangers, 
 “The Lord will provide.”
[v4]
 When Satan assails
 To stop up our path,
 And courage all fails,
 We triumph by faith;
 He cannot take from us,
 Tho’ oft he has tried,
 The heart-cheering promise,
 “The Lord will provide.”
[v5]
 He tells us we’re weak,
 Our hope is in vain;
 The good that we seek
 We ne’er shall obtain;
 But when such suggestions
 Our spirits have plied,
 This answers all questions,
 “The Lord will provide.”
[v6]
 No strength of our own,
 Nor goodness we claim;
 Yet since we have known
 The Savior’s great name.
 In this our strong tower
 For safety we hide;
 The Lord is our power,
 “The Lord will provide.”
[v7]
 When life sinks apace,
 And death is in view,
 The word of His grace
 Shall comfort us through;
 Not fearing or doubting,
 With Christ on our side,
 We hope to die shouting,
 “The Lord will provide.”
