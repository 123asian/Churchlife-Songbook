[v1]
 Hast thou no scar? 
 No hidden scar on foot, or side, or hand? 
 I hear thee sung throughout the land,
 I hear them hail thy shining star, 
 Hast thou no scar? no scar?
[v2]
 Hast thou no wound? 
 Yet I was wounded by the archers, spent, 
 Leaned Me against a tree; and rent 
 By rav’ning beasts ’round me, I swooned: 
 Hast thou no wound? no wound?
[v3]
 No wound? no scar? 
 Yet, as the Master shall the servant be, 
 And pierced the feet that follow Me; 
 But whole? can he have followed far 
 Who has no wound nor scar?
