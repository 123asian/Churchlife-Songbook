[v1]
 Praise God, from whom all blessings flow; 
 Praise Him, all creatures here below; 
 Praise Him above, ye heav'nly host; 
 Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!
[v2]
 Praise God the Father who’s the source; 
 Praise God the Son who is the course; 
 Praise God the Spirit who’s the flow; 
 Praise God, our portion here below!
