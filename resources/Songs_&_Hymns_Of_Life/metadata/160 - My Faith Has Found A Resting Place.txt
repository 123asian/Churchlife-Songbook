[v1]
 My faith has found a resting place, 
 Not in device nor creed; 
 I trust the Ever-living One, 
 His wounds for me shall plead. 
[v2]
 Enough for me that Jesus saves, 
 This ends my fear and doubt; 
 A sinful soul I come to Him, 
 He’ll never cast me out.
[v3]
 My heart is leaning on the Word, 
 The written Word of God, 
 Salvation by my Savior’s name, 
 Salvation through His blood.
[v4]
 My great Physician heals the sick, 
 The lost He came to save; 
 For me His precious blood He shed, 
 For me His life He gave.
[c1]
 I need no other argument, 
 I need no other plea; 
 It is enough that Jesus died, 
 And that He died for me.
