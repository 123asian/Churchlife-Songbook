[v1]
 Why should I fear the darkest hour, 
 Or tremble at the tempter’s pow’r? 
 Jesus vouchsafes to be my tow’r.
[v2]
 Though hot the fight, why quit the field, 
 Why must I either fly or yield, 
 Since Jesus is my mighty shield?
[v3]
 When creature comforts fade and die, 
 Worldlings may weep, but why should I? 
 Jesus still lives, and still is nigh.
[v4]
 Though all the flocks and herds were dead, 
 My soul a famine need not dread, 
 For Jesus is my living bread.
[v5]
 I know not what may soon betide,
 Or how my wants shall be supplied;
 But Jesus knows, and will provide.
[v6]
 Though sin would fill me with distress,
 The throne of grace I dare address,
 For Jesus is my righteousness.
[v7]
 Tho’ faint my prayers and cold my love,
 My steadfast hope shall not remove,
 While Jesus intercedes above.
[v8]
 Against me earth and hell combine; 
 But on my side is pow’r divine;
 Jesus is all, and He is mine.
