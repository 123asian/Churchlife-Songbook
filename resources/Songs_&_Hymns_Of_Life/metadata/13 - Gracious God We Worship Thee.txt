[v1]
 Gracious God, we worship Thee, 
 Revâ€™rently we bow the knee; 
 Jesus Christ, our only plea:   
 Father, we adore Thee.
[v2]
 Vast Thy love, how deep, how wide, 
 In the gift of Him who died; 
 Righteous claims all satisfied: 
 Father, we adore Thee.
[v3]
 Low we bow before Thy face, 
 Sons of God, O wondrous place; 
 Great the riches of Thy grace:  
 Father, we adore Thee.
[v4]
 By Thy Spirit grant that we 
 Worshipers in truth may be; 
 Praise, as incense sweet to Thee: 
 Father, we adore Thee.
[v5]
 Yet again our song we raise, 
 Note of deep adoring praise; 
 Now, and soon through endless days: 
 Father, we adore Thee.
