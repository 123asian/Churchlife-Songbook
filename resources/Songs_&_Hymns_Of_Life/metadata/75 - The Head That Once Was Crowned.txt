[v1]
 The head that once was crowned with thorns, 
 Is crowned with glory now; 
 Heav’ns royal diadem adorns 
 The mighty Victor’s brow.
[v2]
 The joy of all who dwell above, 
 The joy of all below 
 To whom He manifests His love, 
 And grants His name to know. 
[v3]
 To them, the cross with all its shame, 
 With all its grace is giv’n; 
 Their name, an everlasting name, 
 Their joy, the joy of heav’n.
[v4]
 They suffer with their Lord below,
 They reign with Him above;
 Their profit and their joy to know
 The myst’ry of His love.
[v5]
 The cross He bore is life and health,
 Though shame and death to Him;
 His people’s hope, His people’s wealth,
 Their everlasting theme.
