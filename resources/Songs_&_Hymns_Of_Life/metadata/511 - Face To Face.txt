[v1]
 Face to face with Christ, my Savior, 
 Face to face— what will it be, 
 When with rapture I behold Him, 
 Jesus Christ who died for me? 
[v2]
 Only faintly now, I see Him, 
 With the darkling veil between, 
 But a blessed day is coming, 
 When His glory shall be seen.
[v3]
 What rejoicing in His presence, 
 When are banished grief and pain, 
 When the crooked ways are straightened, 
 And the dark things shall be plain.
[v4]
 Face to face— oh, blissful moment! 
 Face to face— to see and know; 
 Face to face with my Redeemer, 
 Jesus Christ who loves me so!
[c1]
 Face to face I shall behold Him, 
 Far beyond the starry sky; 
 Face to face in all His glory, 
 I shall see Him by and by!
