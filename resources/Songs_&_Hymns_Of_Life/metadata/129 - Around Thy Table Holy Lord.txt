[v1]
 Around Thy table, holy Lord, 
 In fellowship we meet, 
 Obedient to Thy gracious word, 
 This feast of love to eat.
[v2]
 Here every one that loves Thy name, 
 Our willing hearts embrace; 
 Our source of life and hope the same, 
 All debtors to Thy grace.
[v3]
 Commune with each at this blest hour, 
 Thy peace, Thy joy impart; 
 Thy thoughts of love, of truth, of powâ€™r, 
 Impress upon each heart.
