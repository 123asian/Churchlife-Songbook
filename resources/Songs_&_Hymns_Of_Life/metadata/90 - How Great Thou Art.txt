[v1]
 O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder, 
 Consider all the works Thy hands have made; 
 I see the stars, I hear the *rolling thunder 
 Thy pow’r throughout the universe displayed. 
[v2]
 When through the woods and forest glades I wander, 
 And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees: 
 When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur, 
 And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.
[v3]
 And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing, 
 Sent Him to die— I scarce can take it in: 
 That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing, 
 He bled and died to take away my sin:
[v4]
 When Christ shall come, with shouts of acclamation, 
 And take me home— what joy shall fill my heart! 
 Then I shall bow, in humble adoration, 
 And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!
[c1]
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee: 
 How great Thou art! How great Thou art! 
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee, 
 How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
