[v1]
 We bless Thee, God and Father, 
 We joy before Thy face; 
 Beyond dark death forever, 
 We share Thy Son’s blest place. 
 He lives a Man before Thee 
 In cloudless light above, 
 In Thine unbounded favor, 
 Thine everlasting love.
[v2]
 His Father and our Father, 
 His God and ours Thou art; 
 And He is Thy Beloved,
 The gladness of Thy heart. 
 We’re His, in joy He brings us 
 To share His part and place, 
 To know Thy love and favor, 
 The shining of Thy face.
[v3]
 Thy love that now enfolds us 
 Can ne’er wax cold or dim; 
 In Him that love doth center, 
 And we are loved in Him. 
 In Him Thy love and glory 
 Find their eternal rest; 
 The many sons— His brethren— 
 In Him, how near, how blest!
