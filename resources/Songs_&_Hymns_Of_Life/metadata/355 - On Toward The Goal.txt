[v1]
 “On toward the goal!” Press on! 
 Alone, yet unafraid; 
 He cut the path, who beckons thee, 
 On then, and undismayed.
[v2]
 “On toward the goal!” Press on! 
 The eyes that are aflame 
 Are watching thee, what then are men? 
 What matter praise, or blame?
[v3]
 “On toward the goal!” Press on! 
 Look not behind thee now, 
 When just ahead lies His “Well done,” 
 And crowns await thy brow.
[v4]
 “On toward the goal!” Press on! 
 Blind, deaf and sometimes dumb 
 Along the blood-marked, uphill way, 
 Hard after Christ, press on!
