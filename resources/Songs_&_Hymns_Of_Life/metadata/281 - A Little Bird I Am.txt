[v1]
 A little bird I am, 
 Shut from the fields of air, 
 And in my cage I sit and sing 
 To Him who placed me there; 
 Well pleased a prisoner to be, 
 Because, my God, it pleaseth Thee.
[v2]
 Nought have I else to do, 
 I sing the whole day long; 
 And He whom most I love to please 
 Doth listen to my song; 
 He caught and bound my wand’ring wing; 
 But still He bends to hear me sing.
[v3]
 Thou hast an ear to hear 
 A heart to love and bless; 
 And though my notes were e’er so rude, 
 Thou wouldst not hear the less; 
 Because Thou knowest as they fall, 
 That love, sweet love, inspires them all.
[v4]
 My cage confines me round; 
 Abroad I cannot fly; 
 But though my wing is closely bound, 
 My heart’s at liberty; 
 For prison walls cannot control 
 The flight, the freedom of the soul.
[v5]
 O it is good to soar 
 These bolts and bars above! 
 To Him whose purpose I adore, 
 Whose providence I love; 
 And in Thy mighty will to find 
 The joy, the freedom of the mind.
