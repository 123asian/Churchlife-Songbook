[v1]
 Safe in the arms of Jesus, 
 Safe on His gentle breast, 
 There by His love o’er-shaded, 
 Sweetly my soul doth rest. 
 Hark! ’tis a song of heaven 
 Borne in the sweetest voice, 
 Echoed by saints in spirit, 
 Making my heart rejoice. 
[v2]
 Safe in the arms of Jesus, 
 Safe from corroding care, 
 Safe from the world’s temptations, 
 Sin cannot harm me there.
 Free from the blight of sorrow, 
 Free from my doubts and fears; 
 Only a few more trials, 
 Only a few more tears.
[v3]
 Jesus, my heart’s dear Refuge,
 Jesus has died for me;
 Firm on the Rock of Ages 
 Ever my trust shall be. 
 Here let me wait with patience, 
 Wait till the night is o’er, 
 Wait till I see the morning 
 Break on the golden shore.
[c1]
 Safe in the arms of Jesus, 
 Safe on His gentle breast, 
 There by His love o’er-shaded, 
 Sweetly my soul doth rest.
