[v1]
 Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrifice; 
 You became nothing, poured out to death. 
 Many times I’ve wondered at Your gift of life, 
 and I’m in that place once again. 
 I’m in that place once again.  
[v2]
 Now You are exalted to the highest place, 
 Soon everyone will bow and confess; 
 But for now, I marvel at this saving grace, 
 and I’m full of praise once again. 
 I’m full of praise once again.
[c1]
 Once again I look upon the cross where You died. 
 I’m humbled by Your mercy and I’m broken inside. 
 Once again I thank You, once again I pour out my life. 
 Thank You for the cross. 
 Thank You for the cross. 
 Thank You for the cross, my Friend.
