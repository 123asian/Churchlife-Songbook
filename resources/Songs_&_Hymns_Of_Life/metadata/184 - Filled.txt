[v1]
 Blessed, mighty Holy Ghost, 
 Fill me to the uttermost; 
 Let my life Thy channel be, 
 Just a channel, Lord, for Thee; 
 Through me all Thy fullness pour, 
 Give me ever more and more.
[v2]
 Blessed, mighty Holy Ghost, 
 Fill me to the uttermost; 
 Be it unto me, O Lord, 
 Now, according to Thy Word, 
 Let the life of Jesus be, 
 Ever filling, even me.
[v3]
 Blessed, mighty Holy Ghost, 
 Fill me to the uttermost; 
 Cleansed and holy, pure and clean, 
 Let the life of Christ be seen, 
 Hold o’er me Thy gracious sway, 
 Every hour of every day.
[v4]
 Blessed, mighty Holy Ghost, 
 Fill me to the uttermost; 
 For Thy love, Thy light, Thy pow’r, 
 Just a channel hour by hour, 
 Till my Savior’s face I see, 
 Fill me Lord, fill even me.
