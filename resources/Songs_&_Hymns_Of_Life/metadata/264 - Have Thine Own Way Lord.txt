[v1]
 Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way! 
 Thou art the Potter, I am the clay. 
 Mold me and make me after Thy will, 
 While I am waiting, yielded and still.
[v2]
 Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way! 
 Search me and try me, Master, today. 
 Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,    
 As in Thy presence humbly I bow.
[v3]
 Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way! 
 Wounded and weary, help me, I pray. 
 Power, all power, surely is Thine, 
 Touch me and heal me, Savior divine.
[v4]
 Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way! 
 Hold oâ€™er my being absolute sway. 
 Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see 
 Christ only, always, living in me.
