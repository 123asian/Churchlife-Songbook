[v1]
 Marvelous grace of our loving Lord, 
 Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt,
 Yonder on Calvary’s mount outpoured, 
 There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt. 
[v2]
 Sin and despair like the sea-waves cold, 
 Threaten the soul with infinite loss; 
 Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold, 
 Points to the refuge, the mighty cross. 
[v3]
 Dark is the stain that we cannot hide, 
 What can avail to wash it away? 
 Look! there is flowing a crimson tide; 
 Whiter than snow you may be today.
[v4]
 Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace, 
 Freely bestowed on all who believe; 
 You that are longing to see His face, 
 Will you this moment His grace receive?
[c1]
 Grace, grace, God’s grace, 
 Grace that will pardon and cleanse within; 
 Grace, grace, God’s grace, 
 Grace that is greater than all our sin.
