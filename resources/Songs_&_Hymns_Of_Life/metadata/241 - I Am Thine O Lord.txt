[v1]
 I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice, 
 And it told Thy love to me; 
 But I long to rise in the arms of faith, 
 And be closer drawn to Thee. 
[v2]
 Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord, 
 By the powâ€™r of grace divine; 
 Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope, 
 And my will be lost in Thine.
[v3]
 O the pure delight of a single hour 
 That before Thy throne I spend, 
 When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God, 
 I commune as friend with friend!
[v4]
 There are depths of love that I yet may know 
 Ere Thee face to face I see; 
 There are heights of joy that I yet may reach 
 Ere I rest in peace with Thee.
[c1]
 Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, 
 To the cross where Thou hast died; 
 Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, 
 To Thy precious, bleeding side.
