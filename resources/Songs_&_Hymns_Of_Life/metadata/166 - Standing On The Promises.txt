[v1]
 Standing on the promises of Christ my King, 
 Through eternal ages let His praises ring, 
 Glory in the highest, I will shout and sing, 
 Standing on the promises of God. 
[v2]
 Standing on the promises that cannot fail, 
 When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail, 
 By the living Word of God I shall prevail, 
 Standing on the promises of God.
[v3]
 Standing on the promises I now can see 
 Perfect, present cleansing in the blood for me; 
 Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free, 
 Standing on the promises of God.
[v4]
 Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,
 Bound to Him eternally by love’s strong cord,
 Overcoming daily with the Spirit’s sword,
 Standing on the promises of God.
[v5]
 Standing on the promises I cannot fall,
 List’ning every moment to the Spirit’s call.
 Resting in my Savior as my all in all,
 Standing on the promises of God.
[c1]
 Standing, standing, 
 Standing on the promises of God my Savior; 
 Standing, standing, 
 I’m standing on the promises of God.
