[v1]
 What a fellowship, what a joy divine, 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms! 
 What a blessedness, what a peace is mine, 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms! 
[v2]
 O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way, 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms! 
 O how bright the path grows from day to day, 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms!
[v3]
 What have I to dread, what have I to fear,
 Leaning on the everlasting arms? 
 I have blessed peace with my Lord so near, 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms!
[c1]
 Leaning, leaning, 
 Safe and secure from all alarms; 
 Leaning, leaning, 
 Leaning on the everlasting arms.
