[v1]
 Take my life, and let it be 
 Consecrated, Lord, to Thee. 
 Take my moments and my days, 
 Let them flow in ceaseless praise, 
 Let them flow in ceaseless praise.
[v2]
 Take my hands, and let them move 
 At the impulse of Thy love. 
 Take my feet and let them be 
 Swift and beautiful for Thee,
 Swift and beautiful for Thee.
[v3]
 Take my voice, and let me sing 
 Always, only, for my King. 
 Take my lips, and let them be 
 Filled with messages from Thee, 
 Filled with messages from Thee.
[v4]
 Take my silver and my gold; 
 Not a mite would I withhold. 
 Take my intellect, and use 
 Every pow’r as Thou shalt choose, 
 Every pow’r as Thou shalt choose.
[v5]
 Take my will, and make it Thine;
 It shall be no longer mine.
 Take my heart; it is Thine own;
 It shall be Thy royal throne,
 It shall be Thy royal throne.
[v6]
 Take my love; my Lord, I pour
 At Thy feet its treasure-store.
 Take myself, and I will be
 Ever, only, all for Thee,
 Ever, only, all for Thee.
