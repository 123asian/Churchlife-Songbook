[v1]
 Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah, 
 Pilgrim through this barren land; 
 I am weak, but Thou art mighty, 
 Hold me with Thy pow’rful hand; 
 Bread of heaven, Bread of heaven, 
 Feed me till I want no more; 
 Feed me till I want no more.
[v2]
 Open now the crystal fountain, 
 Whence the healing stream shall flow; 
 Let the fire and cloudy pillar 
 Lead me all my journey through; 
 Strong Deliv’rer, strong Deliv’rer, 
 Be Thou still my Strength and Shield, 
 Be Thou still my Strength and Shield.
[v3]
 Lord, I trust Thy mighty power, 
 Wondrous are Thy works of old; 
 Thou deliver’st Thine from thralldom, 
 Who for naught themselves had sold: 
 Thou didst conquer, Thou didst conquer, 
 Sin, and Satan and the grave, 
 Sin, and Satan and the grave.
[v4]
 Musing on my habitation, 
 Musing on my heav’nly home, 
 Fills my soul with holy longings: 
 Come, my Jesus, quickly come; 
 Vanity is all I see; 
 Lord, I long to be with Thee! 
 Lord, I long to be with Thee!
