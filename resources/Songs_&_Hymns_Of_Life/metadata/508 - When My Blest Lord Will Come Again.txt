[v1]
 When my blest Lord will come again, 
 I will be saved from all my pain, 
 With all the saints I’ll follow Him, 
 O praise the Lord! 
 O praise the Lord! O praise the Lord! 
 With all the saints I’ll follow Him, 
 O praise the Lord!
[v2]
 When I shall see Him face to face, 
 And dwell with Him through endless days, 
 I will rejoice and sing His grace, 
 O praise the Lord! 
 O praise the Lord! O praise the Lord! 
 I will rejoice and sing His grace,  
 O praise the Lord!
[v3]
 When I meet Him before the Throne, 
 My suff’rings then will all be gone, 
 The joy of vict’ry will be won, 
 O praise the Lord! 
 O praise the Lord! O praise the Lord! 
 The joy of vict’ry will be won,  
 O praise the Lord!
[v4]
 In that day I will testify 
 That nothing with Christ’s life can vie, 
 What glorious rapture to the sky, 
 O praise the Lord! 
 O praise the Lord! O praise the Lord! 
 What glorious rapture to the sky,  
 O praise the Lord!
[v5]
 May we in our Lord’s side e’er hide,
 Be always one and ne’er divide,
 That His heart may be satisfied,
 O praise the Lord!
 O praise the Lord! O praise the Lord!
 That His heart may be satisfied,
 O praise the Lord!   
[v6]
 O come, our King, O come, dear Lord!
 Receive us by Thy promised word,
 And give the victors Thy reward,
 O praise the Lord!
 O praise the Lord! O praise the Lord!
 And give the victors Thy reward,
 O praise the Lord!
