[v1]
 Deep down into the depths of this Thy Name, 
 My God, I sink and dwell in calm delight; 
 Thou art enough however long the day, 
 Thou art enough however dark the night.
[v2]
 Thou art my God— the All-Sufficient One, 
 Thou canst create for me whate’er I lack;
 Thy mighty hand has strewn the lonely track 
 With miracles of love and tender care
[v3]
 For me Thy trusting one. My God I dare 
 Once more to fling myself upon Thy breast, 
 And there adore Thy ways in faith’s deep rest, 
 And there adore Thy ways in faith’s quiet rest.
