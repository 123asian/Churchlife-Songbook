[v1]
 Rest, rest thee, weary heart, 
 Let toil and anguish cease; 
 Take from Thy Savior’s hands 
 Thine heritage of peace.
[v2]
 Lie low before His feet, 
 Too low thou canst not be,
 For sacred calm is here, 
 And here is liberty.
[v3]
 Submit, lay down thine arms, 
 Nor question, nor rebel; 
 So shalt thou hear erewhile 
 His whisper, It is well.
[v4]
 No secret wound of thine, 
 Though it be great or small, 
 Presume to hide from Him; 
 Confess, confess it all.
[v5]
 Nor merit of thine own
 Upon His altar place;
 All is of Christ alone,
 And of His perfect grace.
[v6]
 Rest, rest thee, weary heart,
 Let care and anguish cease;
 Take from thy Savior’s hands
 Thine heritage of peace.
