[v1]
 Go, labor on; spend, and be spent; 
 Thy joy to do the Father’s will; 
 It is the way the Master went; 
 Should not the servant tread it still?
[v2]
 Go, labor on: ’tis not for nought; 
 Thine earthly loss is heav’nly gain; 
 Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not; 
 The Master praises, what are men?
[v3]
 Go, labor on; your hands are weak, 
 Your knees are faint, your soul cast down; 
 Yet falter not; the prize you seek 
 Is near, a kingdom and a crown.
[v4]
 Go, labor on while it is day,
 The world’s dark night is hastening on;
 Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away,
 It is not thus that souls are won.
[v5]
 Men die in darkness at your side,
 Without a hope to cheer the tomb;
 Take up the torch and wave it wide,
 The torch that lights time’s thickest gloom.
[v6]
 Press on, faint not, keep watch and pray; 
 Be wise the erring soul to win;
 Go forth into the world’s highway,
 Compel the wanderer to come in.
[v7]
 Press on, and in thy work rejoice;
 For work comes rest, the prize thus won;
 Soon shalt thou hear the Master’s voice,
 The midnight cry, Behold, I come!
