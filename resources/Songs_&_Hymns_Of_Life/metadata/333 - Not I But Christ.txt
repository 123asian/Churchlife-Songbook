[v1]
 Not I, but Christ be honored, loved, exalted, 
 Not I, but Christ be seen, be known be heard; 
 Not I, but Christ in every look and action, 
 Not I, but Christ in every thought and word. 
[v2]
 Not I, but Christ to gently soothe in sorrow, 
 Not I, but Christ to wipe the falling tear; 
 Not I, but Christ to lift the weary burden, 
 Not I, but Christ to hush away all fear.
[v3]
 Christ, only Christ, no idle word e’er falling, 
 Christ, only Christ, no needless bustling sound; 
 Christ, only Christ, no self important bearing, 
 Christ, only Christ, no trace of “I” be found.
[v4]
 Not I, but Christ my every need supplying,
 Not I, but Christ my strength and health to be;
 Christ, only Christ, for body, soul and spirit,
 Christ, only Christ, live then Thy life in me.
[v5]
 Christ, only Christ, ere long will fill my vision,
 Glory excelling soon, full soon I’ll see;
 Christ, only Christ, my every wish fulfilling,
 Christ, only Christ, my all in all to be.
[c1]
 Oh, to be saved from myself, dear Lord, 
 Oh, to be lost in Thee. 
 Oh, that it may be no more I, 
 But Christ that lives in me.
