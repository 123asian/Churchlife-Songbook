[v1]
 I’ve tried in vain a thousand ways 
 My fears to quell, my hopes to raise; 
 But what I need, the Bible says, 
 Is ever, only Jesus.
[v2]
 My soul is night, my heart is steel— 
 I cannot see, I cannot feel; 
 For light, for life I must appeal 
 In simple faith to Jesus.
[v3]
 He died, He lives, He reigns, He pleads; 
 There’s love in all His words and deeds; 
 There’s all a guilty sinner needs 
 Forevermore in Jesus.
[v4]
 Though some should sneer, and some should blame, 
 I’ll go with all my guilt and shame; 
 I’ll go to Him because His name, 
 Above all names, is Jesus.
