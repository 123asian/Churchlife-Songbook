[v1]
 I am so glad that our Father in heav’n 
 Tells of His love in the Book He has giv’n; 
 Wonderful things in the Bible I see: 
 This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.
[v2]
 Though I forget Him and wander away, 
 Still He doth love me wherever I stray; 
 Back to His dear loving arms would I flee, 
 When I remember that Jesus loves me.
[v3]
 Jesus loves me, and I know I love Him; 
 Love brought Him down my poor soul to redeem; 
 Yes, it was love made Him die on the tree; 
 Oh, I am certain that Jesus loves me!
[v4]
 If one should ask of me, how can I tell?
 Glory to Jesus, I know very well!
 God’s Holy Spirit with mine doth agree,
 Constantly witnessing—Jesus loves me.
[v5]
 In this assurance I find sweetest rest,
 Trusting, in Jesus, I know I am blest;
 Satan, dismayed, from my soul now doth flee,
 When I just tell him that Jesus loves me.
[v6]
 Oh, if there’s only one song I can sing,
 When in His beauty I see the great King,
 This shall my song in eternity be,
 “Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me!”
[c1]
 I am so glad that Jesus loves me, 
 Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me; 
 I am so glad that Jesus loves me. 
 Jesus loves even me.
