[v1]
 We are a moment, You are forever, 
 Lord of the ages, God before time; 
 We are a vapor, You are eternal; 
 Love everlasting, reigning on high. 
[v2]
 We are the broken, You are the healer, 
 Jesus, Redeemer, mighty to save; 
 You are the love song weâ€™ll sing forever, 
 bowing before You, blessing Your name.
[c1]
 Holy, holy Lord God Almighty, 
 Worthy is the Lamb Who was slain; 
 Highest praises honor and glory 
 be unto Your name, be unto Your name.
