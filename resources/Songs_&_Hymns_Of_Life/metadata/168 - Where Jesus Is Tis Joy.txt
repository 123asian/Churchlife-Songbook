[v1]
Since Christ my soul from sin set free,
This life has been a joy to me;
And ’mid earth’s sorrows and its woe,
’Tis joy my Jesus here to know.

[v2]
The earth was once a bitter place
Till Jesus showed His smiling face;
Now joy’s begun within my soul,
’Twill last while endless ages roll.

[v3]
What matters where on earth we dwell?
On mountain top, or in the dell,
In cottage, or a mansion fair,
Where Jesus is, my joy is there.

[c1]
O hallelujah, yes, ’tis joy!
For it is Christ that I enjoy!
On land or sea, what matters where?
Where Jesus is, my joy is there.
