[v1]
 O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found, 
 And found in Thee alone, 
 The peace, the joy I sought so long, 
 The bliss till now unknown. 
[v2]
 I sighed for rest and happiness, 
 I yearned for them, not Thee; 
 But, while I passed my Savior by, 
 His love laid hold on me.
[v3]
 I tried the broken cisterns, Lord, 
 But, ah, the waters failed! 
 E’en as I stooped to drink they fled,
 And mocked me as I wailed.
[v4]
 The pleasures lost I sadly mourned, 
 But never wept for Thee, 
 Till grace the sightless eyes received, 
 Thy loveliness to see.
[c1]
 Now none but Christ can satisfy, 
 None other name for me;  
 There’s love and life and lasting joy, 
 Lord Jesus, found in Thee.
