[v1]
 Holy Spirit, breathe on me, 
 Until my heart is clean; 
 Let sunshine fill its inmost part, 
 With not a cloud between. 
[v2]
 Holy Spirit, breathe on me, 
 My stubborn will subdue; 
 Teach me in words of living flame 
 What Christ would have me do.
[v3]
 Holy Spirit, breathe on me,
 Fill me with powâ€™r divine; 
 Kindle a flame of love and zeal 
 Within this heart of mine.
[v4]
 Holy Spirit, breathe on me, 
 Till I am all Thine own, 
 Until my will is lost in Thine, 
 To live for Thee alone.
[c1]
 Breathe on me, breathe on me, 
 Holy Spirit, breathe on me; 
 Take Thou my heart, cleanse every part, 
 Holy Spirit, breathe on me.
