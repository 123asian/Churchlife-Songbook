[v1]
 O blessed Savior, is Thy love 
 So great, so full, so free? 
 Behold, I give my love, my heart, 
 My life, my all to Thee.
[v2]
 I love Thee for the glorious worth 
 Which in Thyself I see; 
 I love Thee for that shameful cross, 
 Thou hast endured for me.
[v3]
 No man of greater love can boast 
 Than for his friend to die; 
 Thou for Thine enemies wast slain! 
 What love with Thine can vie?
[v4]
 Though in the very form of God, 
 With heav’nly glory crowned,
 Thou wouldst partake of human flesh,
 Beset with troubles round.
[v5]
 Thou wouldst like wretched man be made
 In everything but sin,
 That we as like Thee might become
 As we unlike had been:
[v6]
 Like Thee in faith, in meekness, love,
 In every beauteous grace,
 From glory into glory changed,
 Till we behold Thy face.
[v7]
 O Lord, I'll treasure in my soul
 The mem’ry of Thy love;
 And Thy dear name shall still to me
 A grateful odor prove.
