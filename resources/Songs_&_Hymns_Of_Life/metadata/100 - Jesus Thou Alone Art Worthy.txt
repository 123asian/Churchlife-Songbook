[v1]
 Jesus, Thou alone art worthy 
 Ceaseless praises to receive;
 For Thy love and grace and goodness 
 Rise o’er all our thoughts conceive.
[v2]
 With adoring heart, we render 
 Honor to Thy precious name, 
 Overflowing with Thy mercies, 
 Far and wide Thy worth proclaim.
[v3]
 Praise Him! praise Him! praise the Savior! 
 Saints, aloud your voices raise, 
 Praise Him! praise Him! till in glory 
 Perfected we’ll sing His praise.
