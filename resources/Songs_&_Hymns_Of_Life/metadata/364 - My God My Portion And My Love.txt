[V1]
 My God, my Portion, and my Love, 
 My everlasting All, 
 I’ve none but Thee in heav’n above, 
 Or on this earthly ball, 
 Or on this earthly ball.
[V2]
 What empty things are all the skies, 
 And this inferior clod! 
 There’s nothing here deserves my joys, 
 There’s nothing like my God, 
 There’s nothing like my God.
[V3]
 To Thee I owe my wealth, and friends, 
 And health, and safe abode; 
 Thanks to Thy name for meaner things, 
 But they are not my God, 
 But they are not my God.
[V4]
 How vain a toy is glitt’ring wealth, 
 If once compared to Thee! 
 Or what’s my safety, or my health, 
 Or all my friends to me?  
 Or all my friends to me?
[V5]
 Were I possessor of the earth,
 And called the stars my own,
 Without Thy graces and Thyself,
 I were a wretch undone.
I were a wretch undone.
[V6]
 Let others stretch their arms like seas,
 And grasp in all the shore;
 Grant me the visits of Thy grace,
 And I desire no more.
And I desire no more.
