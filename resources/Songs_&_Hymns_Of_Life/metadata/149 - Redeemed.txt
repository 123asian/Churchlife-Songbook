[v1]
 Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it! 
 Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; 
 Redeemed throâ€™ His infinite mercy, 
 His child, and forever, I am. 
[v2]
 Redeemed and so happy in Jesus, 
 No language my rapture can tell; 
 I know that the light of His presence 
 With me doth continually dwell.
[v3]
 I think of my blessed Redeemer, 
 I think of Him all the day long; 
 I sing, for I cannot be silent; 
 His love is the theme of my song.
[v4]
 I know I shall see in His beauty 
 The King in whose way I delight; 
 Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
 And giveth me songs in the night.
[c1]
 Redeemed, redeemed, 
 Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; 
 Redeemed, redeemed, 
 His child, and forever, I am.
