[v1]
 All I once held dear, built my life upon, 
 All this world reveres, and wars to own, 
 All I once thought gain I have counted loss; 
 Spent and worthless now, compared to this. 
[v2]
 Now my heart’s desire is to know You more 
 To be found by You, and known as Yours, 
 To possess by faith what I could not earn; 
 All surpassing gift of righteousness.
[v3]
 Oh to know the pow’r of Your risen life, 
 And to know You in Your sufferings, 
 To become like You in Your death my Lord; 
 So with You to live, and never die.
[c1]
 Knowing You, Jesus, knowing You, there is no greater thing. 
 You’re my all, You’re the best, 
 You’re my joy, my righteousness, and I love You, Lord.
