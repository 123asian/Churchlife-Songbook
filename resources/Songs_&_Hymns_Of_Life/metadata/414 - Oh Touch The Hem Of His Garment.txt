[v1]
 She only touched the hem of His garment 
 As to His side she stole, 
 Amid the crowd that gathered around Him; 
 And straightway she was whole. 
[v2]
 She came in fear and trembling before Him, 
 She knew her Lord had come, 
 She felt that from Him virtue had healed her, 
 The mighty deed was done.
[v3]
 He turned with “Daughter, be of good comfort, 
 Thy faith hath made thee whole!” 
 And peace that passeth all understanding 
 With gladness filled her soul.
[c1]
 Oh, touch the hem of His garment, 
 And thou, too, shalt be free! 
 His healing pow’r this very hour 
 Shall give new life to thee!
