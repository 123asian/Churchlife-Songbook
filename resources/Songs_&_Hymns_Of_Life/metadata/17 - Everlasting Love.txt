[v1]
 Father ’twas Thy love that knew us 
 Earth’s foundations long before: 
 That same love to Jesus drew us 
 By its sweet constraining pow’r. 
 And will keep us, and will keep us, 
 Safely now, and evermore, 
 Safely now, and ever more.
[v2]
 Now that changeless love enfolds us, 
 All its wealth on us bestows; 
 While its pow’r unchanging holds us 
 In a holy calm repose. 
 God and Father, God and Father, 
 Unto Thee our worship flows, 
 Unto Thee our worship flows.
[v3]
 God of love, our souls adore Thee! 
 We would still Thy grace proclaim, 
 Till we cast our crowns before Thee, 
 And in glory praise Thy name; 
 Praise and worship, praise and worship 
 Be to God and to the Lamb! 
 Be to God and to the Lamb!
