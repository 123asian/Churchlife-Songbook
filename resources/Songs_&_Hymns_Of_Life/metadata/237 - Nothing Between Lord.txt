[v1]
 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between; 
 Let me Thy glory see, 
 Draw my soul close to Thee, 
 Then speak in love to me— 
 Nothing between, Nothing between.
[v2]
 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between; 
 Let not earth’s din and noise 
 Stifle Thy still small voice; 
 In it let me rejoice— 
 Nothing between, Nothing between.
[v3]
 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between; 
 Nothing of earthly care, 
 Nothing of tear or prayer, 
 No robe that self may wear— 
 Nothing between, Nothing between.
[v4]
 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between; 
 Unbelief disappear, 
 Vanish each doubt and fear, 
 Fading when Thou art near— 
 Nothing between, Nothing between.
[v5]
 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
 Shine with unclouded ray,
 Chasing each mist away,
 O’er my whole heart bear sway—
 Nothing between, Nothing between.
[v6]
 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
 Thus may I walk with Thee,
 Thee only may I see,
 Thine only let me be—
 Nothing between, Nothing between.
[v7]
 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
 Till Thine eternal light,
 Rising on earth’s dark night,
 Bursts on my open sight—
 Nothing between, Nothing between.
[v8]
 Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
 Till, the last conflict o’er,
 I stand on Canaan’s shore
 With Thee for evermore—
 Nothing between, Nothing between.
