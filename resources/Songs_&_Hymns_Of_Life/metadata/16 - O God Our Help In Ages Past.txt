[v1]
 O God, our help in ages past, 
 Our hope for years to come, 
 Our shelter from the stormy blast, 
 And our eternal home.
[v2]
 Under the shadow of Thy throne 
 Thy saints have dwelt secure; 
 Sufficient is Thine arm alone, 
 And our defense is sure.
[v3]
 Before the hills in order stood, 
 Or earth received her frame, 
 From everlasting Thou art God, 
 To endless years the same.
[v4]
 A thousand ages in Thy sight 
 Are like an evening gone; 
 Short as the watch that ends the night 
 Before the rising sun.
[v5]
 Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
 Bears all its sons away;
 They fly, forgotten, as a dream
 Dies at the opening day.
[v6]
 O God, our help in ages past,
 Our hope for years to come,
 Be Thou our guard while troubles last,
 And our eternal home.
