[v1]
 Lord, Thou hast won, at length I yield; 
 My heart by mighty grace compelled 
 Surrenders all to Thee; 
 Against Thy terrors long I strove, 
 But who can stand against Thy love? 
 Love conquers even me.
[v2]
 But since Thou hast Thy love revealed, 
 And shown my soul a pardon sealed, 
 I can resist no more: 
 Could’st Thou for such a sinner bleed? 
 Can’st Thou for such a rebel plead? 
 I wonder and adore!
[v3]
 If Thou hadst bid Thy thunders roll,  
 And light’nings flash, to blast my soul, 
 I still had stubborn been; 
 But mercy has my heart subdued, 
 A bleeding Savior I have viewed, 
 And now I hate my sin.
[v4]
 Now, Lord, I would be Thine alone, 
 Come, take possession of Thine own, 
 For Thou hast set me free; 
 Released from Satan’s hard command, 
 See all my powers waiting stand, 
 To be employed by Thee.
