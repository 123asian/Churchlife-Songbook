[v1]
 Thine be the glory, risen, conqu’ring Son; 
 Endless is the vict’ry Thou o’er death hast won; 
 Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away, 
 Kept the folded grave-clothes, where Thy body lay. 
[v2]
 Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb; 
 Lovingly He greets us, scatters fear and gloom; 
 Let the Church with gladness, hymns of triumph sing, 
 For her Lord now liveth, death hath lost its sting.
[c1]
 Thine be the glory, risen, conqu’ring Son, 
 Endless is the vict’ry Thou o’er death hast won.
