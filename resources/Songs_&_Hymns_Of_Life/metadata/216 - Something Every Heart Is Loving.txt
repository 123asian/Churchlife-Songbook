[v1]
 Something every heart is loving; 
 If not Jesus none can rest; 
 Lord, my heart to Thee is given; 
 Take it for it loves Thee best.
[v2]
 Thus I cast the world behind me; 
 Jesus most beloved shall be; 
 Beauteous more than all things beauteous, 
 He alone is joy to me.
[v3]
 Bright with all eternal radiance 
 Is the glory of Thy face; 
 Thou art loving, sweet, and tender, 
 Full of pity, full of grace.
[v4]
 When I hated, Thou didst love me, 
 Sheddâ€™st for me Thy precious blood; 
 Still Thou lovest, lovest ever, 
 Shall I not love Thee, my God?
[v5]
 Keep my heart still faithful to Thee, 
 That my earthly life may be 
 But a shadow to that glory 
 Of my hidden life in Thee.
