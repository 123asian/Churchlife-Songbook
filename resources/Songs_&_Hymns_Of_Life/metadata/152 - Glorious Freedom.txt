[v1]
 Once I was bound by sin’s galling fetters; 
 Chained like a slave I struggled in vain.  
 But I received a glorious freedom, 
 When Jesus broke my fetters in twain. 
[v2]
 Freedom from all the carnal affections, 
 Freedom from envy, hatred and strife; 
 Freedom from vain and worldly ambitions, 
 Freedom from all that saddened my life!
[v3]
 Freedom from pride and all sinful follies, 
 Freedom from love and glitter of gold; 
 Freedom from evil temper and anger; 
 Glorious freedom, rapture untold!
[v4]
 Freedom from fear with all of its torments,
 Freedom from care with all of its pain; 
 Freedom in Christ my blessed Redeemer— 
 He who has rent my fetters in twain.
[c1]
 Glorious freedom! Wonderful freedom! 
 No more in chains of sin I repine! 
 Jesus the glorious Emancipator— 
 Now and forever He shall be mine.
