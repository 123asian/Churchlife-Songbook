[v1]
 Lord Jesus Christ, we would remember Thee, 
 As, on the table, we the emblems see; 
 Thy holy body shadowed in the bread, 
 Thy precious blood is in the cup portrayed.
[v2]
 Lord, we adore Thee for Thy matchless grace, 
 That Thou, for us, did take the servant’s place; 
 From Godhead’s glory to the shameful tree, 
 From wealth, so vast, to abject poverty!
[v3]
 O Lamb of God, we join to bless Thy name, 
 That Thou, on Calv’ry, bore our sin and shame; 
 And, by Thy death, did put our guilt away, 
 Triumphant rose, our night to turn to day.
[v4]
 We see Thee now, at God’s right hand enthroned, 
 Vested with honor and with glory crowned; 
 Blessed Redeemer, Savior, Lord, to Thee
 Be all the glory, pow’r and majesty!
