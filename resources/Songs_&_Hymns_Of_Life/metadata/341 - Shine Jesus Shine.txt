[v1]
 Lord, the light of Your love is shining, 
 in the midst of the darkness, shining; 
 Jesus, Light of the world, shine upon us, 
 set us free by the truth You now bring us. 
 Shine on me, shine on me. 
[v2]
 Lord, I come to Your awesome presence, 
 from the shadows into Your radiance; 
 By the blood I may enter Your brightness, 
 search me, try me, consume all my darkness. 
 Shine on me, shine on me.
[v3]
 As we gaze on Your kingly brightness, 
 so our faces display Your likeness; 
 Ever changing from glory to glory, 
 mirrored here may our lives tell Your story.
 Shine on me, shine on me.
[c1]
 Shine, Jesus, shine, fill this land with the Fatherâ€™s glory; 
 Blaze Spirit, blaze, set our hearts on fire. 
 Flow, river, flow, flood the nations with grace and mercy; 
 Send forth Your word, Lord, and let there be light.
