[v1]
Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return, 
 And come with singing unto Zion; 
 And everlasting joy shall be upon their head. 
 Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return, 
 And come with singing unto Zion; 
 And everlasting joy shall be upon their head. 
 They shall obtain gladness and joy; 
 And sorrow and mourning 
 Shall flee away.
