[v1]
 O how great His salvation! 
 O how great His salvation! 
 O how great His salvation! 
 Jesus saves me now!
[v2]
 All my sins are forgiven! 
 All my fetters are riven! 
 I enjoy peace of heaven! 
 Jesus saves me now!
[v3]
 Neither sin nor temptation, 
 Neither Satan’s vexation, 
 Nor the world’s best elation 
 Can enslave me now!
[v4]
 I will sing Hallelujah! 
 I will sing Hallelujah! 
 I will sing Hallelujah! 
 Jesus saves me now!
[c1]
 Jesus breaks every fetter! 
 Jesus breaks every fetter! 
 Jesus breaks every fetter! 
 Jesus sets me free!
