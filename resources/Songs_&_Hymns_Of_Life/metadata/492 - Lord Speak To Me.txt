[v1]
 Lord, speak to me, that I may speak 
 In living echoes of Thy tone; 
 As Thou hast sought, so let me seek 
 Thy erring children lost and lone.
[v2]
 O lead me, Lord, that I may lead 
 The wand’ring and the wav’ring feet; 
 O feed me, Lord, that I may feed 
 Thy hung’ring ones with manna sweet.
[v3]
 O strengthen me, that while I stand 
 Firm on the rock, and strong in Thee,  
 I may stretch out a loving hand 
 To wrestlers with the troubled sea.
[v4]
 O teach me, Lord, that I may teach
 The precious things Thou dost impart;
 And wing my words, that they may reach
 The hidden depths of many a heart.
[v5]
 O give Thine own sweet rest to me,
 That I may speak with soothing power
 A word in season, as from Thee
 To weary ones in needful hour.
[v6]
 O fill me with Thy fulness, Lord, 
 Until my very heart o’erflow
 In kindling thought and glowing word,
 Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.
[v7]
 O use me, Lord, use even me,
 Just as Thou wilt, and when, and where,
 Until Thy blessed face I see,
 Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share!
