[v1]
 Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ, 
 Nor creed, nor form, nor word, 
 Nor holy church, nor human love,  
 Compare with Thee, my Lord!
[v2]
 Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ, 
 Thy love has conquered me; 
 Beneath Thy cross I die to self,  
 And live alone to Thee.
[v3]
 Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ, 
 My inmost being fill; 
 So shall I think as Thou dost think,  
 And will as Thou dost will.
[v4]
 Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,
 Thy life transfigure mine;
 And through this veil of mortal flesh,
 Lord, let Thy splendor shine.
[v5]
 Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,
 My soul exults in Thee;
 To be Thy slave, to do Thy will,
 Is my felicity.
