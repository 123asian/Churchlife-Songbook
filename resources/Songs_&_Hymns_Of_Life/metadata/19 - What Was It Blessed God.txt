[v1]
 What was it, blessed God, 
 Led Thee to give Thy Son, 
 To yield Thy well-beloved 
 For us by sin undone? 
 ’Twas love unbounded led Thee thus, 
 ’Twas love unbounded led Thee thus 
 To give Thy well-beloved for us.
[v2]
 What led Thy Son, O God, 
 To leave Thy throne on high, 
 To shed His precious blood, 
 To suffer and to die? 
 ’Twas love unbounded   love to us, 
 ’Twas love unbounded love to us 
 Led Him to die and suffer thus.
[v3]
 What moved Thee to impart 
 Thy Spirit from above, 
 Therewith to fill our heart 
 With heav’nly peace and love? ’
 Twas love unbounded love to us, 
 ’Twas love unbounded love to us 
 Moved Thee to give Thy Spirit thus.
[v4]
 What love to Thee we owe, 
 Our God, for all Thy grace! 
 Our hearts may well o’erflow  
 In everlasting praise! 
 Make us, O God, to praise Thee thus, 
 Make us, O God, to praise Thee thus 
 For all Thy boundless love to us.
