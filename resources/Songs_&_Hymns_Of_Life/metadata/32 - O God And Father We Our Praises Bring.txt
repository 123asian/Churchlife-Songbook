[v1]
 O God and Father, we our praises bring, 
 For who more worthy of our praise could be 
 Than Thou, who seekest worshipers who sing 
 In spirit and in truth adoringly!
[v2]
 All worlds Thou hast created by the Son, 
 All things are held by His unmeasured power; 
 Yet we approach Thee in that glorious One: 
 What cause for worship in this holy hour!
[v3]
 â€™Tis He who leads us in this blessed sphere, 
 In the assembly singing praise to Thee; 
 What joy to Him that we should thus be near 
 As suited and in perfect liberty!
[v4]
 Here we unite, our song of joy is one! 
 And Thou, O God, art fully satisfied. 
 Amidst the praises led by Christ, Thy Son, 
 Thou hast a dwelling ever to abide.
