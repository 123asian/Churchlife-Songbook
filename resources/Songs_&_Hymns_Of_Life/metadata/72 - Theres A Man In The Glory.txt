[v1]
 There’s a Man in the glory 
 Whose Life is for me. 
 He’s pure and He’s holy, 
 Triumphant and free. 
 He’s wise and He’s loving, 
 How tender is He! 
 His Life in the glory, 
 My life must be; 
 His Life in the glory, 
 My life must be.
[v2]
 There’s a Man in the glory 
 Whose Life is for me.
 He overcame Satan; 
 From bondage He’s free. 
 In Life He is reigning; 
 How kingly is He! 
 His Life in the glory, 
 My life must be; 
 His Life in the glory, 
 My life must be; 
[v3]
 There’s a Man in the glory 
 Whose Life is for me. 
 In Him is no sickness; 
 No weakness has He.
 He’s strong and in vigor, 
 How buoyant is He! 
 His Life in the glory, 
 My life may be; 
 His Life in the glory, 
 My life may be. 
[v4]
 There’s a Man in the glory 
 Whose Life is for me. 
 His peace is abiding;
 How patient is He! 
 He’s joyful and radiant, 
 Expecting to see 
 His Life in the glory 
 Lived out in me; 
 His Life in the glory 
 Lived out in me.
