[v1]
 Open my eyes that I may see 
 Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me; 
 Place in my hands the wonderful key 
 That shall unclasp and set me free. 
[v2]
 Open my ears that I may hear 
 Voices of truth Thou sendest clear; 
 And while the wave-notes fall on my ear, 
 Everything false will disappear.
[v3]
 Open my mouth and let me bear 
 Tidings of mercy everywhere; 
 Open my heart and let me prepare 
 Love with Thy children thus to share.
[c1]
 Silently now I wait for Thee, 
 Ready, my God, Thy will to see; 
 Open my eyes, illumine me, Spirit Divine!
