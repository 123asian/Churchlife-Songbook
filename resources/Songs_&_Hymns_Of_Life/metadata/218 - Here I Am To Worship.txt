[v1]
 Light of the world, You stepped down into darkness, 
 opened my eyes, let me see. 
 Beauty that made this heart adore You, 
 hope of a life spent with You. 
[v2]
 King of all days, oh so highly exalted, 
 glorious in heaven above. 
 Humbly You came to the earth You created, 
 all for love’s sake became poor.
[c1]
 Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down, 
 here I am to say that You’re my God. 
 You’re altogether lovely, altogether worthy, 
 altogether wonderful to me. 
 And I’ll never know how much it cost 
 to see my sin upon that cross.
