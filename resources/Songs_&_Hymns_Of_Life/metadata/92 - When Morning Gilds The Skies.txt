[v1]
 When morning gilds the skies, 
 My heart awaking cries, 
 May Jesus Christ be praised! 
 Alike at work and prayer, 
 O Jesus I repair; 
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
[v2]
 To Thee, my God above, 
 I cry with glowing love, 
 May Jesus Christ be praised! 
 The fairest graces spring 
 In hearts that ever sing, 
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
[v3]
 Does sadness fill my mind? 
 A solace here I find, 
 May Jesus Christ be praised! 
 Or fades my earthly bliss? 
 My comfort still is this, 
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
[v4]
 When evil thoughts molest, 
 With this I shield my breast, 
 May Jesus Christ be praised! 
 The pow’rs of darkness fear, 
 When this sweet chant they hear, 
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
[v5]
 When sleep her balm denies,
 My silent spirit sighs, 
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 The night becomes as day,
 When from the heart we say,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
[v6]
 Be this, while life is mine,
 My canticle divine,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 Be this th’eternal song
 Through all the ages long,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
