[v1]
 One day when heaven was filled with His praises, 
 One day when sin was as black as could be, 
 Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin— 
 Dwelt among men, my example is He! 
[v2]
 One day they led Him up Calvary’s mountain, 
 One day they nailed Him to die on the tree; 
 Suffering anguish, despised and rejected;
 Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He.
[v3]
 One day they left Him alone in the garden, 
 One day He rested, from suffering free; 
 Angels came down o’er His tomb to keep vigil; 
 Hope of the hopeless, my Savior is He.
[v4]
 One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,
 One day the stone rolled away from the door;
 Then He arose, over death He had conquered;
 Now is ascended, my Lord evermore.
[v5]
 One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,
 One day the skies with His glory will shine;
 Wonderful day, my belovéd ones bringing;
 Glorious Savior, this Jesus is mine!
[c1]
 Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me; 
 Buried, He carried my sins far away; 
 Rising, He justified freely forever: 
 One day He’s coming— O glorious day!
