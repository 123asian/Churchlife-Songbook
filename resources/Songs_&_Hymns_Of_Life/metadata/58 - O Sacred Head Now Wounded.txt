[v1]
 O sacred Head, now wounded with grief and shame weighed down; 
 Now scornfully surrounded with thorns, Thine only crown. 
 How pale Thou art with anguish, with sore abuse and scorn; 
 How does that visage languish, which once was bright as morn!
[v2]
 What Thou, my Lord, hast suffered was all for sinners’ gain; 
 Mine, mine was the transgression, but Thine the deadly pain. 
 Lo, here I fall, my Savior; ’tis I deserve Thy place. 
 Look on me with Thy favor; vouchsafe to me Thy grace.
[v3]
 What language shall I borrow to thank Thee, dearest Friend, 
 For this Thy dying sorrow, Thy pity without end? 
 O make me Thine forever; and, should I fainting be, 
 Lord, let me never, never outlive my love to Thee.
[v4]
 Be near when I am dying, O show Thy cross to me; 
 And for my succor flying, come, Lord, to set me free. 
 These eyes, new faith receiving, from Jesus shall not move; 
 For he who dies believing, dies safely, through Thy love.
