[V1]
 Jesus only is our message, 
 Jesus all our theme shall be;      
 We will lift up Jesus ever, 
 Jesus only will we see.
[V2]
 Jesus only is our Savior, 
 All our guilt He bore away, 
 All our righteousness He gives us, 
 All our strength from day to day.
[V3]
 Jesus is our Sanctifier, 
 Saving us from self and sin, 
 And with all His Spirit’s fulness, 
 Filling all our hearts within.
[V4]
 Jesus only is our Healer, 
 All our sicknesses He bare, 
 And His risen life and fulness, 
 All His members still may share.
[V5]
 Jesus only is our Power, 
 He the gift of Pentecost;
 Jesus, breathe Thy pow’r upon us,
 Fill us with the Holy Ghost.
[V6]
 And for Jesus we are waiting, 
 List’ning for the Advent Call;
 But ’twill still be Jesus only,
 Jesus ever, all in all. 
[C1]
 Jesus only, Jesus ever, 
 Jesus all in all we sing,   
 Savior, Sanctifier, and Healer,
 Glorious Lord and coming King.
