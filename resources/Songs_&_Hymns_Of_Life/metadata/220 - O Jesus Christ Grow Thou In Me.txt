[v1]
 O Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me, 
 And all things else recede; 
 My heart be daily nearer Thee, 
 From sin be daily freed. 
[v2]
 In Thy bright beams which on me fall, 
 Fade every evil thought; 
 That I am nothing, Thou art all, 
 I would be daily taught.
[v3]
 More of Thy glory let me see, 
 Thou Holy, Wise, and True;
 I would Thy living image be, 
 In joy and sorrow too.
[v4]
 Fill me with gladness from above,
 Hold me by strength divine;
 Lord, let the glow of Thy great love
 Through all my being shine.
[v5]
 Make this poor self grow less and less,
 Be Thou my life and aim;
 Oh, make me daily through Thy grace
 More meet to bear Thy name.
[c1]
 Each day let Thy supporting might 
 My weakness still embrace; 
 My darkness vanish in Thy light, 
 Thy life my death efface.
