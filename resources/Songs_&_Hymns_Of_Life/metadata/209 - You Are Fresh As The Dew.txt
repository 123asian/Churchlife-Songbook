[v1]
 You are fresh as the dew of the morning, Lord; 
 Like a stream flowing free, You supply my need. 
 Lord, I open my heart to You, my beloved One; 
 Whisp’ring all of my thoughts, bathing in Your love.
[v2]
 How can I fully say what is in my heart, 
 When You pour out Your love fully unto me? 
 Like a fountain of water, Your love my spirit fills; 
 Like a bright flame of fire, in my bosom burns.
[v3]
 Come and burn all away that is not of You, 
 Burn away all the dross of the earthly loves. 
 Let me be whiter than the snow in Your love, dear Lord;
 Let me live in Yourself, Your unblemished love.
[v4]
 I’m in You; I am filled with Your life of love; 
 Of our union in love, I will testify. 
 All my strength, all my weakness is swallowed in Your love; 
 My dear Lord, now I live by Your love divine.
