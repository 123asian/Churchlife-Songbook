[v1]
 I have learned the wondrous secret 
 Of abiding in the Lord; 
 I have found the strength and sweetness 
 Of confiding in His word; 
 I have tasted life’s pure fountain, 
 I am drinking of His blood, 
 I have lost myself in Jesus, 
 I am sinking into God. 
[v2]
 I am crucified with Jesus, 
 And He lives and dwells with me; 
 I have ceased from all my struggling, 
 ’Tis no longer I, but He. 
 All my will is yielding to Him, 
 And His Spirit reigns within; 
 And His precious blood each moment 
 Keeps me cleansed and free from sin.
[v3]
 All my sicknesses I bring Him, 
 And He bears them all away; 
 All my fears and griefs I tell Him 
 All my cares from day to day, 
 All my strength I draw from Jesus, 
 By His breath I live and move; 
 E’en His very mind He gives me, 
 And His faith, and life, and love.
[v4]
 For my words I take His wisdom, 
 For my works His Spirit’s pow’r; 
 For my ways His ceaseless presence 
 Guards and guides me every hour. 
 Of my heart, He is the Portion, 
 Of my joy the boundless Spring; 
 Savior, Sanctifier, Healer, 
 Glorious Lord, and coming King.
[c1]
 I’m abiding in the Lord 
 And confiding in His word; 
 I am hiding in the bosom of His love. 
 Yes, abiding in the Lord 
 And confiding in His word, 
 I am hiding in the bosom of His love.
