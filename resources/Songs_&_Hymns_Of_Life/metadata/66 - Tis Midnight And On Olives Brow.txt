[v1]
 ’Tis midnight, and on Olive’s brow 
 The star is dimmed that lately shone; 
 ’Tis midnight in the garden now, 
 The suff’ring Savior prays alone.
[v2]
 ’Tis midnight, and from all removed, 
 The Savior wrestles lone with fears — 
 E’en that disciple whom He loved 
 Heeds not his Master’s grief and tears.
[v3]
 ’Tis midnight, and for others’ guilt 
 The Man of Sorrows weeps in blood; 
 Yet He that hath in anguish knelt 
 Is not forsaken by His God.
[v4]
 ’Tis midnight, and from ether-plains 
 Is borne the song that angels know — 
 Unheard by mortals are the strains 
 That sweetly soothe the Savior’s woe.
