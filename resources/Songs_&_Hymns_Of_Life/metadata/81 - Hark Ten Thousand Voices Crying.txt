[v1]
 Hark! ten thousand voices crying 
 “Lamb of God!” with one accord; 
 Thousand thousand saints replying, 
 Wake at once the echo’ng chord.
[v2]
 “Praise the Lamb!” the chorus waking, 
 All in heav’n together throng; 
 Loud and far, each tongue partaking, 
 Rolls around the endless song.
[v3]
 Grateful incense this, ascending 
 Ever to the Father’s throne; 
 Every knee to Jesus bending, 
 All the mind in heav’n is one.
[v4]
 All the Father’s counsels claiming
 Equal honors to the Son;
 All the Son’s effulgence beaming, 
 Makes the Father’s glory known.
[v5]
 By the Spirit all pervading,
 Hosts unnumbered round the Lamb,
 Crowned with light and joy unfading,
 Hail Him as the great “I AM.”
[v6]
 Joyful now the new creation
 Rests in undisturbed repose,
 Blest in Jesus’ full salvation,
 Sorrow now nor *thraldom knows.
[v7]
 Hark! still louder swells the singing,
 As the notes are heard again;
 Through creation’s vault is ringing
 Joy’s response. Amen! Amen!
