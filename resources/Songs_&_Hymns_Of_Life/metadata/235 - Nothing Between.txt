[v1]
 Nothing between my soul and the Savior, 
 Naught of this world’s delusive dream; 
 I have renounced all sinful pleasure; 
 Jesus is mine, there’s nothing between.
[v2]
 Nothing between, like worldly pleasure; 
 Habits of life, though harmless they seem, 
 Must not my heart from Him e’er sever; 
 He is my all, there’s nothing between.
[v3]
 Nothing between, like pride or station; 
 Self-life or friends shall not intervene; 
 Though it may cost me much tribulation,
 I am resolved; there’s nothing between.
[v4]
 Nothing between, e’en many hard trials, 
 Though the whole world against me convene; 
 Watching with prayer and much self-denial, 
 I’ll triumph at last, there’s nothing between.
[c1]
 Nothing between my soul and the Savior, 
 So that His blessed face may be seen; 
 Nothing preventing the least of His favor, 
 Keep the way clear! Let nothing between.
