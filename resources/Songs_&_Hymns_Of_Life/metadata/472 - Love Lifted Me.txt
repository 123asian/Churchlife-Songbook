[v1]
 I was sinking deep in sin, 
 Far from the peaceful shore, 
 Very deeply stained within, 
 Sinking to rise no more; 
 But the Master of the sea 
 Heard my despairing cry, 
 From the waters lifted me, 
 Now safe am I. 
[v2]
 All my heart to Him I give, 
 Ever to Him I’ll cling, 
 In His blessed presence live, 
 Ever His praises sing. 
 Love so mighty and so true 
 Merits my soul’s best songs; 
 Faithful, loving service, too, To Him belongs.
[v3]
 Souls in danger, look above, 
 Jesus completely saves; 
 He will lift you by His love 
 Out of the angry waves. 
 He’s the Master of the sea, 
 Billows His will obey; 
 He your Savior wants to be— 
 Be saved today.
[c1]
 Love lifted me! Love lifted me! 
 When nothing else could help, 
 Love lifted me. (repeat)
