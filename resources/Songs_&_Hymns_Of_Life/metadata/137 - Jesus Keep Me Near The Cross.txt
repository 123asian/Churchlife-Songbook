[v1]
 Jesus, keep me near the cross, 
 There a precious fountain, 
 Free to all— a healing stream, 
 Flows from Calv’ry’s mountain. 
[v2]
 Near the cross, a trembling soul, 
 Love and mercy found me; 
 There the Bright and Morning Star
 Sheds its beams around me.
[v3]
 Near the cross! O Lamb of God, 
 Bring its scenes before me; 
 Help me walk from day to day, 
 With its shadow o’er me.
[v4]
 Near the cross I’ll watch and wait, 
 Hoping, trusting ever, 
 Till I see my Savior’s face, 
 Leave His presence never.
[c1]
 In the cross, in the cross, 
 Be my glory ever; 
 From the cross my ransomed soul 
 Nothing then shall sever.
