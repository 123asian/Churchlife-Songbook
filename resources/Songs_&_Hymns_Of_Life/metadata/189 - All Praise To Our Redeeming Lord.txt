[v1]
 All praise to our redeeming Lord, 
 Who joins us by His grace,  
 And bids us, each to each restored, 
 Together seek His face,  
 Together seek His face.
[v2]
 He bids us build each other up;
 And, gathered into one, 
 To our high calling’s glorious hope, 
 We hand in hand go on, 
 We hand in hand go on.
[v3]
 The gift which He on one bestows, 
 We all delight to prove; 
 The grace through every vessel flows 
 In purest streams of love, 
 In purest streams of love.
[v4]
 We all partake the joy of one;
 The common peace we feel;
 A peace to worldly minds unknown,
 A joy unspeakable,
 A joy unspeakable.
[v5]
 And if our fellowship below
 In Jesus be so sweet,
 What height of rapture shall we know,
 When ’round His throne we meet!
 When ’round His throne we meet!
