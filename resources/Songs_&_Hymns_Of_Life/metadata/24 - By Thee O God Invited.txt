[v1]
 By Thee, O God, invited, 
 We look unto the Son, 
 In whom Thy heart delighted, 
 Who all Thy will hath done; 
 And by the one chief treasure 
 Thy bosom freely gave, 
 Thine own pure love we measure, 
 Thy willing mind to save.
[v2]
 O God of mercy— Father! 
 The one unchanging claim, 
 The brightest hopes, we gather 
 From Christ’s most precious name: 
 What always sounds so sweetly 
 In Thine unwearied ear, 
 Has freed our souls completely 
 From all our guilt and fear.
[v3]
 The trembling sinner feareth 
 That God can ne’er forget; 
 But one full payment cleareth 
 His mem ’ry of all debt. 
 When nought beside could free us, 
 Or set our souls at large, 
 The death of God’s Beloved 
 Secured a full discharge.
[v4]
 No wrath God’s heart retaineth 
 To usward who believe; 
 No dread in ours remaineth 
 As we His love receive; 
 Returning sons He kisses, 
 And with His robe invests; 
 His perfect love dismisses 
 All terror from our breasts.
