[v1]
 Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation! 
 O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation! 
 All ye who hear, 
 Now to His temple draw near; 
 Sing now in glad adoration!
[v2]
 Praise to the Lord, who oâ€™er all things so wondrously reigneth, 
 Who, as on wings of an eagle, uplifteth, sustaineth. 
 Hast thou not seen 
 How thy desires all have been 
 Granted in what He ordaineth?
[v3]
 Praise to the Lord, who hath fearfully, wondrously, made thee! 
 Health hath vouchsafed and, when heedlessly falling, hath stayed thee. 
 What need or grief 
 Ever hath failed of relief? 
 Wings of His mercy did shade thee.
[v4]
 Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee,
 Who from the heavens the streams of His mercy doth send thee.
 Ponder anew
 What the Almighty can do,
 Who with His love doth befriend thee.
[v5]
 Praise to the Lord! O let all that is in me adore Him!
 All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before Him!
 Let the Amen
 Sound from His people again;
 Gladly for aye we adore Him.
