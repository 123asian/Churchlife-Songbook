[v1]
 Lord Jesus, when I think on Thee, 
 Of all Thy love and grace, 
 My spirit longs and fain would see, 
 Thy beauty face to face.
[v2]
 And though the wilderness I tread, 
 A barren, thirsty ground, 
 With thorns and briars overspread, 
 Where foes and snares abound;
[v3]
 Yet in Thy love such depths I see, 
 My soul oâ€™erflows with praise; 
 Contents itself while, Lord, to Thee 
 My joyful song I raise.
[v4]
 My Lord, my life, my rest, my shield,
 My rock, my food, my light,
 Each thought of Thee doth constant yield
 Unchanging, fresh delight.
[v5]
 My Savior, keep my spirit stayed, 
 Hard following after Thee,
 Till I, in robes of white arrayed,
 Thy face in glory see.
