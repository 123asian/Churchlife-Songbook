[v1]
 Thou Magnet of my soul! 
 Let me come nearer, till 
 The life of self pulsates no more, 
 But is forever still.
[v2]
 Thou Sunshine of my heart! 
 Fill Thou each crevice there, 
 And let Thy garden yield to Thee 
 A fragrance sweet and rare.
[v3]
 Thou Ransomer from death! 
 Possess Thy ransomed one: 
 Appropriate to Thine own use 
 The spoil that Thou hast won.
[v4]
 Thou Lord of Life and Light!
 I bow beneath Thy sway,
 And count it holy privilege
 Thy precepts to obey.
[v5]
 Thou Gift unspeakable!
 Straight from Godâ€™s heart of love;
 I break my heart to give Thee room
 And thus Thy sweetness prove.
