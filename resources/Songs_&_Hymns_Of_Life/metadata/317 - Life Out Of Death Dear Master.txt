[v1]
 Life out of death— dear Master, is it spoken 
 Of the life here, or in the better land? 
 Nay, wherefore wait? The vessel marred and broken, 
 Shall now be molded by the Potter’s hand.
[v2]
 Life out of death— oh, wondrous resurrection! 
 Seed sown in conscious weakness, raised in pow’r; 
 Thy life lived out in days of toil and friction, 
 “Not I, but Christ” in me from hour to hour.
[v3]
 Life out of death— a pilgrim path and lonely, 
 Trodden by those who glory in the Cross. 
 They live in fellowship with “Jesus only,” 
 And for His sake count earthly gain but loss.
[v4]
 Life out of death— blessed mission to be ever 
 Bearing the living water brimming o’er, 
 With life abundant from the clear, pure river, 
 Telling that thirsty souls need thirst no more.
