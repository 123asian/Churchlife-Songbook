[v1]
 In the secret of His presence how my soul delights to hide! 
 Oh, how precious are the lessons which I learn at Jesus’ side! 
 Earthly cares can never vex me, neither trials lay me low; 
 For when Satan comes to tempt me, to the secret place I go, 
 To the secret place I go.
[v2]
 When my soul is faint and thirsty, ’neath the shadow of His wing 
 There is cool and pleasant shelter, and a fresh and crystal spring; 
 And my Savior rests beside me, as we hold communion sweet; 
 If I tried, I could not utter what He says when thus we meet, 
 What He says when thus we meet.
[v3]
 Only this I know: I tell Him all my doubts and griefs and fears; 
 Oh, how patiently He listens, and my drooping soul He cheers; 
 Do you think He ne’er reproves me? What a false friend He would be, 
 If He never, never told me of the sins which He must see, 
 Of the sins which He must see.
[v4]
 Would you like to know that sweetness of the secret of the Lord? 
 Go and hide beneath His shadow: this shall then be your reward; 
 And whene’er you leave the silence of that happy meeting place, 
 You must mind and bear the image of the Master in your face, 
 Of the Master in your face.
