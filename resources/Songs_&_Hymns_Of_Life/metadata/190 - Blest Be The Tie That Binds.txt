[v1]
 Blest be the tie that binds 
 Our hearts in Christian love; 
 The fellowship of kindred minds  
 Is like to that above.
[v2]
 Before our Father’s throne, 
 We pour our ardent prayers; 
 Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one— 
 Our comforts and our cares.
[v3]
 We share our mutual woes; 
 Our mutual burdens bear; 
 And often for each other flows 
 The sympathizing tear.
[v4]
 When we asunder part,
 It gives us inward pain;
 But we shall still be joined in heart,
 And hope to meet again.
[v5]
 From sorrow, toil, and pain,
 And sin we shall be free;
 And perfect love and oneness reign
 Through all eternity.
