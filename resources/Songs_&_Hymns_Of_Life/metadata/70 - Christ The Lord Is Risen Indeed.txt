[v1]
 Christ the Lord is ris’n indeed, Hallelujah! 
 He has met His people’s need, Hallelujah!
 Raise your joys and triumphs high, Hallelujah! 
 Sing, ye heav’ns and earth, reply, Hallelujah!
[v2]
 Lives again our glorious King, Hallelujah! 
 Where, O Death, is now thy sting? Hallelujah! 
 Dying once He all doth save, Hallelujah! 
 Where thy victory O grave? Hallelujah!
[v3]
 Love’s redeeming work is done, Hallelujah! 
 Fought the fight, the battle won, Hallelujah! 
 Death in vain forbade Him rise, Hallelujah! 
 Christ ascended o’er the skies, Hallelujah!
[v4]
 Soar we now where Christ hath led, Hallelujah! 
 Foll’wing our exalted Head, Hallelujah! 
 Made like Him, like Him we rise, Hallelujah! 
 Free from all the earthly ties, Hallelujah!
