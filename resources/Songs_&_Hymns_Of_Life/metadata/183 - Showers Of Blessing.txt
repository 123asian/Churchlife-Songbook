[v1]
 “There shall be showers of blessing:” 
 This is the promise of love; 
 There shall be seasons refreshing, 
 Sent from the Savior above. 
[v2]
 “There shall be showers of blessing—” 
 Precious reviving again; 
 Over the hills and the valleys, 
 Sound of abundance of rain.
[v3]
 “There shall be showers of blessing;” 
 Send them upon us, O Lord! 
 Grant to us now a refreshing; 
 Come, and now honor Thy Word.
[v4]
 “There shall be showers of blessing;”
 O that today they might fall,
 Now as to God we’re confessing,
 Now as on Jesus we call!
[v5]
 “There shall be showers of blessing,”
 If we but trust and obey;
 There shall be seasons refreshing,
 If we let God have His way.
[c1]
 Showers of blessing, 
 Showers of blessing we need; 
 Mercy-drops round us are falling, 
 But for the showers we plead.
