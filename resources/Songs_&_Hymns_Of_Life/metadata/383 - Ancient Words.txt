[v1]
 Holy words long preserved 
 for our walk in this world; 
 They resound with God’s own heart, 
 O, let the ancient words impart; 
 Words of life words of hope, 
 give us strength, help us cope; 
 In this world where’er we roam, 
 ancient words will guide us home. 
[v2]
 Holy words of our faith 
 handed down to this age, 
 came to  us through sacrifice; 
 O, heed the faithful words of Christ; 
 Holy words long preserved 
 for our walk in this world; 
 They resound with God’s own heart; 
 O, let the ancient words impart.
[c1]
 Ancient words, ever true, 
 changing me, and changing you; 
 We have come with open hearts, 
 O let the ancient words impart.
