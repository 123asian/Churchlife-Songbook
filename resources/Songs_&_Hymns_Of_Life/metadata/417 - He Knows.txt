[v1]
 I know not what awaits me,   
 God kindly veils my eyes,  
 And o’er each step of my onward way 
 He makes new scenes to rise; 
 And every joy He sends me comes 
 A sweet and glad surprise. 
[v2]
 One step I see before me, 
 ’Tis all I need to see, 
 The light of heav’n more brightly shines 
 When earth’s illusions flee; 
 And sweetly through the silence comes 
 His loving, “Follow Me!”
[v3]
 Oh, blissful lack of wisdom, 
 ’Tis blessed not to know; 
 He holds me with His own right hand, 
 And will not let me go, 
 And lulls my troubled soul to rest 
 In Him who loves me so.
[v4]
 So on I go not knowing; 
 I would not if I might;  
 I’d rather walk in the dark with God 
 Than go alone in the light; 
 I’d rather walk by faith with Him 
 Than go alone by sight.
[c1]
 Where He may lead I’ll follow, 
 My trust in Him repose; 
 And every hour in perfect peace, 
 I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows”; 
 And every hour in perfect peace, 
 I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows.”
