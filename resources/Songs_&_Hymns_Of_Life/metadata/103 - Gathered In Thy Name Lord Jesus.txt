[V1]
 Gathered in Thy name, Lord Jesus,
 Losing sight of all but Thee, 
 O what joy Thy presence gives us, 
 Calling up our hearts to Thee!
[V2]
 Loved with love which knows no measure, 
 Save the Father’s love to Thee, 
 Blessed Lord, our hearts would treasure 
 All the Father’s thoughts of Thee.
[V3]
 All His joy,  His rest, His pleasure— 
 All His deep delight in Thee— 
 Lord, Thy heart alone can measure 
 What Thy Father found in Thee.
[V4]
 How He set His love upon Thee—
 Called Thee His beloved Son; 
 Yet for us He did not spare Thee, 
 By Thy death our life was won.
[V5]
 O the joy, the wondrous singing,
 When we see Thee as Thou art!
 Thy blest name, Lord Jesus, bringing
 Sweetest music to God’s heart.
[V6]
 Notes of gladness, songs unceasing,
 Hymns of everlasting praise,
 Psalms of glory, joy increasing,
 Through God’s endless day of days.
