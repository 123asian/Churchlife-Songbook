[v1]
 Our God and Father, we respond to Thee 
 As sons brought near, 
 Suited in love and holy liberty, 
 To this blest sphere. 
 O wondrous thought, that many there should be 
 Like Christ, for Thy delight eternally!
[v2]
 He, Thy delight, in whom we have our part, 
 Through grace to share 
 Thy love for Him, the Object of Thy heart 
 Beyond compare. 
 His glory in Thy presence now we see, 
 As with Him there in love’s complacency.
[v3]
 ’Tis here He sings— what joy His heart doth find, 
 Thyself to praise, 
 While many sons are stirred in heart and mind 
 One voice to raise 
 In worship, God and Father, unto Thee, 
 Supreme, Thou Source in love’s economy!
