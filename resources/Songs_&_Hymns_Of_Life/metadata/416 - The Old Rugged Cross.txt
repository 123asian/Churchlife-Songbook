[V1]
 On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, 
 The emblem of suff’ring and shame, 
 And I love that old cross where the Dearest and Best 
 For a world of lost sinners was slain. 
[V2]
 Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world, 
 Has a wondrous attraction for me;   
 For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above, 
 To bear it to dark Calvary.
[V3]
 In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine, 
 A wondrous beauty I see; 
 For ’twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died, 
 To pardon and sanctify me.
[C1]
 So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross, 
 Till my trophies at last I lay down; 
 I will cling to the old rugged cross, 
 And exchange it some day for a crown.
