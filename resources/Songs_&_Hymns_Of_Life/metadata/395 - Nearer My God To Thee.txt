[v1]
 Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
 Nearer to Thee;  
 E’en though it be a cross 
 That raiseth me,  
 Still all my song shall be 
 Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
 Nearer to Thee.

[v2]
 Though, like a wanderer, 
 The sun gone down, 
 Darkness comes over me, 
 My rest a stone; 
 Yet in my dreams I’d be 
 Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
 Nearer to Thee.

[v3]
 There let the way appear, 
 Steps unto heav’n; 
 All that Thou sendest me, 
 In mercy giv’n; 
 Angels to beckon me 
 Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
 Nearer to Thee.

[v4]
 Then, with my waking thoughts 
 Bright with Thy praise, 
 Out of my stony griefs 
 Bethel I’ll raise, 
 So by my woes to be 
 Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
 Nearer to Thee.

[v5]
 There in my Father’s home, 
 Safe and at rest, 
 There is my Savior’s love, 
 Perfectly blest; 
 Age after age to be, 
 Nearer my God to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
 Nearer to Thee.

[c1]
 Nearer, my God, to Thee, 
 Nearer to Thee.
