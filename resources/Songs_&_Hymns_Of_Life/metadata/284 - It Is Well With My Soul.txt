[v1]
 When peace like a river attendeth my way, 
 When sorrows like sea billows roll; 
 Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say, 
 “It is well, it is well with my soul!”
[v2]
 Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, 
 Let this blest assurance control, 
 That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate, 
 And hath shed His own blood for my soul.
[v3]
 My sin— oh, the bliss of this glorious thought— 
 My sin, not in part, but the whole,
 Is nailed to His Cross, and I bear it no more; 
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!
[v4]
 For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live; 
 If dark hours about me shall roll, 
 No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life 
 Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.
[v5]
 And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight, 
 The clouds be rolled back as a scroll, 
 The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend, 
 “Even so” it is well with my soul.
[c1]
 It is well with my soul! 
 It is well, it is well with my soul!
