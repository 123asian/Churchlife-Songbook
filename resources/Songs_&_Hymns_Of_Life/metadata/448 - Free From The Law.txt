[v1]
 Free from the law— oh, happy condition! 
 Jesus has bled, and there is remission; 
 Cursed by the law and bruised by the fall, 
 Christ has redeemed us once for all. 
[v2]
 There on the cross your burden up-bearing, 
 Thorns on His brow your Savior is wearing; 
 Never again your sin need appall, 
 You have been pardoned once for all.
[v3]
 Now we are free— there’s no condemnation; 
 Jesus provides a perfect salvation: 
 “Come unto Me,” oh, hear His sweet call, 
 Come, and He saves us once for all.
[v4]
 “Children of God”— oh, glorious calling, 
 Surely His grace will keep us from falling; 
 Passing from death to life at His call, 
 Blessed salvation once for all.
[c1]
 Once for all— oh, sinner, receive it; 
 Once for all— oh, brother, believe it; 
 Cling to the cross, the burden will fall, 
 Christ has redeemed us once for all.
