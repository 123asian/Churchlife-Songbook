[v1]
 Hark! the herald angels sing, 
 “Glory to the newborn King; 
 Peace on earth, and mercy mild; 
 God and sinners reconciled.” 
 Joyful, all ye nations, rise, 
 Join the triumph of the skies; 
 With angelic hosts proclaim, 
 “Christ is born in Bethlehem.” 
[v2]
 Christ, by highest heav’n adored; 
 Christ, the everlasting Lord: 
 Late in time behold Him come, 
 Offspring of a virgin’s womb. 
 Veiled in flesh the Godhead see, 
 Hail th’ incarnate Deity! 
 Pleased as man with man to dwell, 
 Jesus our Immanuel.
[v3]
 Hail the heav’nborn Prince of Peace! 
 Hail the Sun of righteousness! 
 Light and life to all He brings, 
 Ris’n with healing in His wings: 
 Mild He lays His glory by, 
 Born that man no more may die; 
 Born to raise the sons of earth; 
 Born to give them second birth.
[v4]
 Come, Desire of nations, come! 
 Fix in us Thy humble home: 
 Rise, the woman’s conqu’ring seed, 
 Bruise in us the serpent’s head; 
 Adam’s likeness now efface, 
 Stamp Thine image in its place: 
 Final Adam from above, 
 Reinstate us in Thy love.
[c1]
 Hark! the herald angels sing, 
 “Glory to the newborn King.”
