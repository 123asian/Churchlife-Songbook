[v1]
 Glorious, mighty Name of Jesus, 
 Into Thy dear Name I flee;  
 “Set aloft,” I praise and worship, 
 For Thy Name is victory!
[v2]
 Blessed Jesus! Mighty Savior!
 In Thy Name is all I need; 
 Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, 
 Is to drink of Life indeed.
[v3]
 Glorious, mighty Name of Jesus, 
 Heav’n and earth its pow’r proclaim;  
 But forgiven sinners only, 
 Know the balm of Jesus’ Name.
[v4]
 Jesus! Jesus! Name most precious, 
 Balm in pain or mighty sword;  
 In Thy Name, we live and conquer, 
 Blessed, glorious, coming Lord.
