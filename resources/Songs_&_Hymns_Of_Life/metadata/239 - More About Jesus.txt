[v1]
 More about Jesus would I know, 
 More of His grace to others show; 
 More of His saving fulness see, 
 More of His love who died for me. 
[v2]
 More about Jesus let me learn, 
 More of His holy will discern; 
 Spirit of God my teacher be, 
 Showing the things of Christ to me.
[v3]
 More about Jesus; in His Word, 
 Holding communion with my Lord; 
 Hearing His voice in every line, 
 Making each faithful saying mine.
[v4]
 More about Jesus; on His throne, 
 Riches in glory all His own; 
 More of His kingdomâ€™s sure increase; 
 More of His coming, Prince of Peace.
[c1]
 More, more about Jesus, 
 More, more about Jesus; 
 More of His saving fulness see, 
 More of His love who died for me.
