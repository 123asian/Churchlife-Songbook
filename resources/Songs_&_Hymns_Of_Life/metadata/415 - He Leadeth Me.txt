[v1]
 He leadeth me! O blessed thought, 
 O words with heav’nly comfort fraught; 
 Whate’er I do, where’er I be, 
 Still ’tis God’s hand that leadeth me. 
[v2]
 Sometimes ’mid scenes of deepest gloom, 
 Sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom, 
 By waters still, o’er troubled sea, 
 Still ’tis His hand that leadeth me.
[v3]
 Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine, 
 Nor ever murmur or repine; 
 Content, whatever lot I see, 
 Since it is Thou that leadest me.
[v4]
 And when my task on earth is done, 
 When, by Thy grace, the vict’ry’s won, 
 E’en death’s cold wave I will not flee, 
 Since Thou in triumph leadest me.
[c1]
 He leadeth me! He leadeth me! 
 By His own hand He leadeth me; 
 His faithful follower I would be, 
 For by His hand He leadeth me.
