[v1]
 Lower and lower, dear Lord, at Thy feet, 
 Seeking Thy Spirit, Thy mercy so sweet; 
 Down in our need, blessed Master, we fall, 
 Lower and lower; be Thou all in all. 
[v2]
 Lower and lower, dear Savior, we pray, 
 Losing the self-life still more every day; 
 Weak and unworthy, we’re looking above; 
 Empty us wholly, then fill us with love.
[v3]
 Lower and lower; yet higher we rise, 
 Lifted in Jesus, led on to the skies; 
 Humbly we follow the way of the cross, 
 Then, crowns of glory, and gain for all loss.
[c1]
 Lower and lower, down at Thy cross, 
 All the world’s treasure counting but dross; 
 Down at Thy feet, blessed Savior, we fall, 
 Lower, still lower, Christ all in all!
