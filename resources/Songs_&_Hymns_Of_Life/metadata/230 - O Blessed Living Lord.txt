[v1]
 O blessed, living Lord, 
 Engage our hearts with Thee, 
 And strike within some answ’ring chord 
 To love so rich and free!
[v2]
 To know Thy loving heart! 
 To cleave to Thy blest side; 
 To gaze upon Thee where Thou art, 
 And in Thy love abide!
[v3]
 To walk with Thee below! 
 To learn Thy holy ways; 
 And more to Thine own stature grow, 
 To Thine eternal praise!
[v4]
 Thyself our one Desire! 
 Thyself our Object here; 
 The goal to which our hearts aspire— 
 To meet Thee in the air!
