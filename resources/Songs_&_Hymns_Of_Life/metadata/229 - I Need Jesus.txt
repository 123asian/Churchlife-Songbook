[v1]
 I need Jesus, my need I now confess; 
 No friend like Him in times of deep distress; 
 I need Jesus, the need I gladly own; 
 Tho’ some may bear their load alone, Yet I need Jesus. 
[v2]
 I need Jesus, I need a friend like Him, 
 A friend to guide when paths of life are dim; 
 I need Jesus, when foes my soul assail; 
 Alone I know I can but fail, So I need Jesus.
[v3]
 I need Jesus, I need Him to the end; 
 No one like Him, He is the sinner’s friend; 
 I need Jesus, no other friend will do; 
 So constant, kind, so strong and true, Yes, I need Jesus.
[c1]
 I need Jesus, I need Jesus, 
 I need Jesus every day; 
 Need Him in the sunshine hour, 
 Need Him when the storm-clouds low’r; 
 Every day along my way, Yes, I need Jesus.
