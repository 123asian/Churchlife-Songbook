[v1]
 Abide in Thee! in that deep love of Thine, 
 My Jesus, Lord, Thou Lamb of God divine; 
 Down, closely down, as living branch with tree,      
 I would abide, my Lord, my Christ, in Thee.
[v2]
 Abide in Thee! my Savior God, I know 
 How love of Thine so vast in me may flow; 
 My empty vessel, running o’er with joy,   
 Now overflows to Thee without alloy.
[v3]
 Abide in Thee! nor doubt, nor self, nor sin 
 Can e’er prevail with Thy blest life within; 
 Joined to Thyself, communing deep, my soul 
 Knows naught besides its motions to control.
[v4]
 Abide in Thee! ’tis thus I only know 
 The secrets of Thy mind e’en while below— 
 All joy and peace, and knowledge of Thy word,   
 All pow’r and fruit, and service for the Lord.
