[v1]
 Nearest of all is He, 
 Dearest of all to me; 
 Mine in life’s lowly ways, 
 Mine in life’s common days.
[v2]
 True, in the time of care, 
 Fairest, when all is fair, 
 Strength of my helplessness, 
 Always at hand to bless.
[v3]
 Secret of joy untold, 
 Changeless, as years unfold; 
 Nearest of all is He; 
 Dearest of all to me!
