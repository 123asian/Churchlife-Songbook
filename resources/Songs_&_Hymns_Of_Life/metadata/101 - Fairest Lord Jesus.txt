[v1]
 Fairest Lord Jesus! 
 Ruler of all nature! 
 O Thou of God and man the Son! 
 Thee will I cherish, 
 Thee will I honor, 
 Thou, my soul’s glory, joy, and crown!
[v2]
 Fair are the meadows, 
 Fairer still the woodlands, 
 Robed in the blooming garb of spring; 
 Jesus is fairer, 
 Jesus is purer, 
 Who makes the woeful heart to sing!
[v3]
 Fair is the sunshine, 
 Fairer still the moonlight,
 And all the twinkling starry host; 
 Jesus shines brighter, 
 Jesus shines purer, 
 Than all the angels heav’n can boast!
[v4]
 All fairest beauty,
 Heavenly and earthly, 
 Wondrously, Jesus, is found in Thee; 
 None can be nearer, 
 Fairer, or dearer, 
 Than Thou my Savior art to me.
