[v1]
 More love to Thee, O Christ, 
 More love to Thee! 
 Hear Thou the prayer I make 
 On bended knee; 
 This is my earnest plea: 
 More love, O Christ, to Thee, 
 More love to Thee, 
 More love to Thee!
[v2]
 Once earthly joy I craved, 
 Sought peace and rest; 
 Now Thee alone I seek, 
 Give what is best; 
 This all my prayer shall be: 
 More love, O Christ, to Thee, 
 More love to Thee, 
 More love to Thee!
[v3]
 Let sorrow do its work, 
 Send grief and pain; 
 Sweet are Thy messengers, 
 Sweet their refrain, 
 When they can sing with me, 
 More love, O Christ, to Thee, 
 More love to Thee,   
 More love to Thee!
[v4]
 Then shall my latest breath 
 Whisper Thy praise; 
 This be the parting cry 
 My heart shall raise; 
 This still its prayer shall be: 
 More love, O Christ, to Thee, 
 More love to Thee, 
 More love to Thee!
