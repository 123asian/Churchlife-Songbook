[v1]
 How pleasant is the sound of praise!
 It well becomes the saints of God;
 Should we refuse our songs to raise, 
 The stones might tell our shame abroad.
[v2]
 For Him Who washed us in His blood, 
 Let us our sweetest songs prepare; 
 He sought us wand’ring far from God, 
 And now preserves us by His care.
[v3]
 One string there is of sweetest tone, 
 Reserved for sinners saved by grace; 
 ’Tis sacred to one class alone 
 And touched by one peculiar race.
[v4]
 Though angels may with rapture see 
 How mercy flows in Jesus’ blood, 
 It is not theirs to prove, as we, 
 The cleansing virtue of this flood.
[v5]
 Though angels praise the heavenly King,
 And worship Him as God alone,
 We can with exultation sing,
 “He wears our nature on the throne.”
[v6]
 Sweet truth! It yields unceasing cause
 Of wonder and of praise above;
 That man, who late accurséd was,
 Should be the object of such love.
