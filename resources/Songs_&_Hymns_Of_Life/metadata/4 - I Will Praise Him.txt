[v1]
 Glory, glory to the Father! 
 Glory, glory to the Son!   
 Glory, glory to the Spirit! 
 Glory to the Three in One! 
[v2]
 Praise the Father who has purposed! 
 Praise the Son who all has done! 
 Praise the Spirit who transmitteth! 
 Praise the Three who work as one!
[c1]
 Let us praise Him! Let us praise Him! 
 Praise our God, the Three in One!
 Give Him glory; give Him glory! 
 Wondrous things for us our God hath done!
