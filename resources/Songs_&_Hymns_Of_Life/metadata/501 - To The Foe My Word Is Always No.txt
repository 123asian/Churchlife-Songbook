[v1]
 To the foe my word is always, “No,” 
 To the Father it is “Yes;” 
 That His plan and all His counsel 
 Be accomplished with success; 
 When Thine orders I’m obeying, 
 Grant me, Lord, authority 
 To fulfill Thy plan eternal 
 Through the Spirit’s pow’r in me.
[v2]
 To the foe my word is always, “No,” 
 To the Father it is “Yes;” 
 ’Tis my attitude eternal; 
 May the Lord protect and bless, 
 Lest while walking in obedience 
 Satan undermine the way; 
 When I’m list’ning to Thine orders, 
 Grant me mercy, Lord, I pray.
[v3]
 To the foe my word is always, “No,” 
 To the Father it is “Yes;” 
 I completely would obey Him, 
 Though deep suff’ring may oppress. 
 If the Lord will save and keep me, 
 As I forward press with Him, 
 Then no trials shall prevent me, 
 Nor will opposition grim.
