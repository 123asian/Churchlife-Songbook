[v1]
 We have heard the joyful sound: 
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves! 
 Spread the tidings all around: 
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves! 
 Bear the news to every land, 
 Climb the steeps and cross the waves; 
 Onward, ’tis our Lord’s command: 
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
[v2]
 Waft it on the rolling tide: 
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves! 
 Tell to sinners far and wide: 
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
 Sing, ye islands of the sea, 
 Echo back, ye ocean caves; 
 Earth shall keep her jubilee: 
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
[v3]
 Sing above the battle strife: 
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves! 
 By His death and endless life: 
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves! 
 Sing it softly through the gloom, 
 When the heart for mercy craves, 
 Sing in triumph o’er the tomb: 
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
[v4]
 Give the winds a mighty voice: 
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves! 
 Let the nations now rejoice: 
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves! 
 Shout salvation full and free, 
 Highest hills and deepest caves, 
 This our song of victory:
 Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
