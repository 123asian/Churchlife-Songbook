[v1]
 O Breath of Life, come sweeping through us, 
 Revive Thy Church with life and pow’r; 
 O Breath of Life, come cleanse, renew us, 
 And fit Thy Church to meet this hour.
[v2]
 O Wind of God, come bend us, break us, 
 Till humbly we confess our need; 
 Then in Thy tenderness remake us, 
 Revive, restore, for this we plead.
[v3]
 O Breath of Love, come breathe within us, 
 Renewing thought and will and heart; 
 Come, Love of Christ, afresh to win us, 
 Revive Thy Church in every part.
[v4]
 O Heart of Christ, once broken for us, 
 ’Tis there we find our strength and rest; 
 Our broken, contrite hearts now solace, 
 And let Thy waiting Church be blest.
[v5]
 Revive us, Lord! Is zeal abating, 
 While harvest fields are vast and white? 
 Revive us, Lord, the world is waiting, 
 Equip Thy Church to spread the light.
