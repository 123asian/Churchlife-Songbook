[v1]
 Blessed Lord, our hallelujahs 
 Now to Thee we raise; 
 Never could we fully utter 
 All Thy worth and praise! 
[v2]
 Praise the Lamb! Yes, Thou art worthy, 
 Who didst shed Thy blood 
 To redeem Thy saints and make us 
 Kings and priests to God!
[v3]
 Hallelujah! Thou, Lord Jesus, 
 Canst not cease to love; 
 Thine we are and Thine forever, 
 One with Thee above.
[v4]
 Praise the Lord! Yes, hallelujah! 
 Who would hush the song? 
 Join with saints from every nation,
 Every tribe and tongue.
[c1]
 Praise the Lamb, for He is worthy! 
 Sweet eternal strain.  
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
 Praise the Lord! Amen.
