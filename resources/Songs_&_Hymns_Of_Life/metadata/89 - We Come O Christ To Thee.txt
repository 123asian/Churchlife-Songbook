[v1]
 We come, O Christ, to Thee, 
 True Son of God and man, 
 By whom all things consist,
 In whom all life began: 
 In Thee alone we live and move
 And have our being in Thy love.
[v2]
 Thou art the Way to God, 
 Thy blood our ransom paid; 
 In Thee we face our Judge 
 and Maker unafraid. 
 Before the Throne absolved we stand: 
 Thy love has met Thy lawâ€™s demand.
[v3]
 Thou art the living Truth! 
 All wisdom dwells in Thee, 
 Thou Source of every skill, 
 Eternal Verity! 
 Thou great I Am! In Thee we rest, 
 True answer to our every quest.
[v4]
 Thou only art true Life, 
 To know Thee is to live 
 The more abundant life 
 That earth can never give: 
 O Risen Lord! We live in Thee 
 And Thou in us eternally!
[v5]
 We worship Thee Lord Christ, 
 Our Savior and our King, 
 To Thee our youth and strength 
 Adoringly we bring: 
 So fill our hearts that men may see 
 Thy life in us and turn to Thee!
