[v1]
 Fight the good fight with all thy might! 
 Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy right; 
 Lay hold on life, and it shall be 
 Thy joy and crown eternally.
[v2]
 Run the straight race through Godâ€™s good grace, 
 Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face; 
 Life with its way before us lies, 
 Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.
[v3]
 Cast care aside, lean on thy Guide; 
 His boundless mercy will provide; 
 Trust, and thy trusting soul shall prove 
 Christ is its life, and Christ its love.
[v4]
 Faint not nor fear, His arms are near, 
 He changeth not, and thou art dear; 
 Only believe, and thou shalt see 
 That Christ is all in all to thee.
