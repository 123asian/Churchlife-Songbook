[v1]
 Savior, lead me up the mountain, 
 Where the Lord alone is seen, 
 Where we hear the voice from heaven, 
 Where the air is pure and clean. 
[v2]
 Higher up where light increases, 
 Far above all earthly strife, 
 Where the strain of effort ceases, 
 Where in Christ we reign in Life.
[v3]
 Savior, keep me up the mountain 
 Pressing on toward the goal, 
 Till, as one, we share Thine image, 
 And Thy love and grace extol.
[c1]
 Lead me higher up the mountain, 
 Give me fellowship with Thee; 
 In Thy light I see the fountain, 
 And the blood it cleanses me.
