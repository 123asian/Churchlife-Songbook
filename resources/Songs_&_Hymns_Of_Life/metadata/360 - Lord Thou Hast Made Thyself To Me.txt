[v1]
 Lord, Thou hast made Thyself to me 
 A living, bright reality, 
 More present to faith’s vision keen 
 Than any earthly object seen; 
 More dear, more intimately nigh 
 Than e’en the closest earthly tie.
[v2]
 And Thou, blest vision of my soul, 
 Hast made my broken nature whole; 
 Hast purified my base desires, 
 And kindled passion’s holiest fires; 
 My nature Thou hast lifted up, 
 And filled me with a glorious hope.
[v3]
 Nearer and dearer still to me, 
 Thou living, loving Savior be; 
 Brighter the vision of Thy face, 
 More charming still Thy words of grace; 
 So, life shall be transformed to love, 
 A heav’n below— a heav’n above.
