[v1]
 Complete in Thee, no work of mine 
 May take, dear Lord, the place of Thine; 
 Thy blood hath pardon bought for me, 
 And I am now complete in Thee.
[v2]
 Complete in Thee, no more shall sin, 
 Thy grace hath conquered, reign within; 
 Thy voice shall bid the tempter flee, 
 And I shall stand complete in Thee.
[v3]
 Complete in Thee, each want supplied, 
 And no good thing to me denied; 
 Since Thou my portion, Lord, wilt be, 
 I ask no more, complete in Thee.
[v4]
 Dear Savior, when before Thy bar 
 All tribes and tongues assembled are, 
 Among Thy chosen will I be, 
 At Thy right hand, complete in Thee.
[c1]
 Yea, justified! O blessed thought! 
 And sanctified! Salvation wrought! 
 Thy blood hath pardon bought for me, 
 And glorified, I too, shall be!
