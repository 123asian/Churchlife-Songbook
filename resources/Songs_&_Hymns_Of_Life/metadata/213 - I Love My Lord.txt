[v1]
 I love my Lord, but with no love of mine, 
 For I have none to give; 
 I love Thee, Lord, but all the love is Thine, 
 For by Thy love I live. 
 I am as nothing, and rejoice to be 
 Emptied, and lost, and swallowed up in Thee.
[v2]
 Thou, Lord, alone, art all Thy children need, 
 And there is none beside; 
 From Thee the streams of blessedness proceed, 
 In Thee the blessed abide. 
 Fountain of life, and all-abounding grace, 
 Our source, our center, and our dwelling place.
