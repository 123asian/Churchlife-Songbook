[v1]
 Break Thou the Bread of Life, 
 Dear Lord, to me, 
 As Thou didst break the loaves 
 Beside the sea; 
 Beyond the sacred page 
 I seek Thee, Lord; 
 My spirit pants for Thee, 
 O Living Word.
[v2]
 Thou art the Bread of Life, 
 O Lord, to me, 
 Thy holy Word the truth 
 That saveth me; 
 Give me to eat and live 
 With Thee above; 
 Teach me to love Thy truth, 
 For Thou art Love.
[v3]
 Oh, send Thy Spirit, Lord, 
 Now unto me, 
 That He may touch my eyes, 
 And make me see; 
 Show me the truth concealed 
 Within Thy Word, 
 And in Thy Book revealed 
 I see the Lord.
[v4]
 Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord, 
 To me, to me, 
 As Thou didst bless the bread 
 By Galilee; 
 Then shall all bondage cease, 
 All fetters fall, 
 And I shall find my peace, 
 My All in all.
