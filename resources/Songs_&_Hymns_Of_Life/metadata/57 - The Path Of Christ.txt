[v1]
 O Lord, when we the path retrace 
 Which Thou on earth hast trod, 
 To man Thy wondrous love and grace, 
 Thy faithfulness to God;
[v2]
 Thy love, by man so sorely tried, 
 Proved stronger than the grave; 
 The very spear that pierced Thy side 
 Drew forth the blood to save;
[v3]
 Faithful amidst unfaithfulness,
 ’Midst darkness only light, 
 Thou didst Thy Father’s name confess, 
 And in His will delight;
[v4]
 Unmoved by Satan’s subtle wiles,
 Or suff’ring, shame, and loss,
 Thy path, uncheered by earthly smiles,    
 Led only to the cross.
[v5]
 O Lord, with sorrow, and with shame,
 We meekly would confess,
 How little we, who bear Thy name,
 Thy mind and ways express.
[v6]
 Give us Thy meek, Thy lowly mind;
 We fain would like Thee be,
 And all our rest and pleasure find
 In learning, Lord, of Thee.
