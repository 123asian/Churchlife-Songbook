[v1]
 There is a Redeemer— 
 Jesus, God’s own Son; 
 Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, 
 Holy One. 
[v2]
 Jesus, my Redeemer, 
 name above all names; 
 Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, 
 Hope for sinners slain.
[v3]
 When I stand in Glory, 
 I will see His face; 
 There I’ll serve my King forever 
 In that holy place.
[c1]
 Thank You, O my Father, 
 for giving us Your Son, 
 And leaving Your Spirit till 
 the work on earth is done.
