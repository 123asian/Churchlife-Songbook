[v1]
 He giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater, 
 He sendeth more strength when the labors increase, 
 To added affliction He addeth His mercy, 
 To multiplied trials, He multiplies peace.  
[v2]
 When we have exhausted our store of endurance, 
 When our strength has failed ere the day is half done, 
 When we reach the end of our hoarded resources, 
 Our Fatherâ€™s full giving is only begun.
[c1]
 His love has no limit, His grace has no measure, 
 His power no boundary known unto men, 
 For out of His infinite riches in Jesus, 
 He giveth and giveth and giveth again.
