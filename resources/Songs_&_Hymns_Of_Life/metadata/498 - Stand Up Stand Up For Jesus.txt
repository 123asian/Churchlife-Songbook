[v1]
 Stand up! stand up for Jesus! 
 Ye soldiers of the cross; 
 Lift high His royal banner, 
 It must not suffer loss: 
 From vict’ry unto vict’ry 
 His army shall He lead, 
 Till every foe is vanquished 
 And Christ is Lord indeed.
[v2]
 Stand up! stand up for Jesus! 
 The trumpet call obey;    
 Forth to the mighty conflict 
 In this His glorious day. 
 Ye that are men, now serve Him 
 Against unnumbered foes; 
 Let courage rise with danger, 
 And strength to strength oppose.
[v3]
 Stand up! stand up for Jesus! 
 Stand in His strength alone; 
 The arm of flesh will fail you; 
 Ye dare not trust your own. 
 Put on the Gospel armor, 
 And, watching unto prayer, 
 Where duty calls, or danger, 
 Be never wanting there.
[v4]
 Stand up! stand up for Jesus! 
 The strife will not be long:  
 This day the noise of battle, 
 The next the victor’s song; 
 To him that overcometh 
 A crown of life shall be; 
 He, with the King of glory, 
 Shall reign eternally.
