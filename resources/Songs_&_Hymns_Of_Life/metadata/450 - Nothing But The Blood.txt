[v1]
 What can wash away my sin? 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus; 
 What can make me whole again? 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus. 
[v2]
 For my pardon this I see— 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus! 
 For my cleansing this my plea— 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
[v3]
 Nothing can my sin erase— 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus! 
 Naught of works, ’tis all of grace— 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
[v4]
 This is all my hope and peace— 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus! 
 This is all my righteousness— 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
[c1]
 Oh! precious is the flow 
 That makes me white as snow; 
 No other fount I know, 
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
