[v1]
 Tell me not of earthly pleasures, 
 Tempt me not with sordid gain; 
 Mock me not with earth’s illusions, 
 Vex me not with honors vain. 
 I am weaned from sinful idols; 
 I am henceforth not my own; 
 I have giv’n my heart to Jesus, 
 I belong to Him alone. 
[v2]
 Oh, the blessed rest it brings us 
 To belong to Christ alone; 
 We can draw on all His fulness 
 When we’ve nothing of our own. 
 Blessed Jesus, take me, own me, 
 Make me, keep me wholly Thine. 
 Deign to find in me Thy portion, 
 While I joy to call Thee mine.
[v3]
 Weary soul, give up the struggle, 
 Cease at length thyself to own; 
 Give thyself away to Jesus, 
 And belong to Him alone. 
 Once He gave His all to win thee, 
 Now He asks as much of thee; 
 All He has He fully gives thee; 
 Let thy love His portion be.
[c1]
 I am not my own, 
 I am not my own. 
 I belong to Jesus, 
 And I am not my own.
