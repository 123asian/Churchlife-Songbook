[v1]
 Oh, how I love this blessed Book! 
 The story of redeeming grace, 
 Love letter of my Bride groom’s heart 
 And mirror of my Savior’s face.
[v2]
 Oh, how I love this blessed Book! 
 My checkbook on the bank above, 
 Deed of my heav’nly heritage 
 And dying will of Him I love.
[v3]
 Oh, how I love this blessed Book! 
 Bright telescope through which I view 
 The wonders of the world to come 
 And gaze on glories ever new.
[v4]
 Oh, how I love this blessed Book! 
 My guide book all my earthly way, 
 The lamp that cheers my darkest night, 
 The sunshine of my brightest day.
