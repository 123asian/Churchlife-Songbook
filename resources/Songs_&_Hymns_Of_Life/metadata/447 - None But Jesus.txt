[v1]
 Weeping will not save me; 
 Though my face were bathed in tears, 
 That could not allay my fears, 
 Could not wash the sins of years; 
 Weeping will not save me. 
[v2]
 Working will not save me; 
 Purest deeds that I can do, 
 Holiest thoughts and feelings too,
 Cannot form my soul anew; 
 Working will not save me.
[v3]
 Waiting will not save me; 
 Helpless, guilty, lost I lie, 
 In my ear is mercyâ€™s cry; 
 If I wait I can but die: 
 Waiting will not save me.
[v4]
 Praying will not save me;
 All the prayers that I could say
 Could not wash my sins away,
 All I owe could never pay:
 Praying will not save me.
[v5]
 Faith in Christ will save me;
 Let me trust Thy gracious Son,
 Trust the work that He has done,
 To His arms, Lord, help me run;
 Faith in Christ will save me.
[c1]
 Jesus wept and died for me; 
 Jesus suffered on the tree; 
 Jesus waits to make me free, 
 He alone can save me.
