[v1]
 Lord, I hear of show’rs of blessing 
 Thou art scatt’ring full and free; 
 Show’rs the thirsty land refreshing; 
 Let some drops now fall on me, 
[v2]
 Pass me not, O gracious Father! 
 Sinful tho’ my heart may be; 
 Thou might’st spurn me, but the rather 
 Let Thy mercy fall on me,
[v3]
 Pass me not, O tender Savior! 
 Let me love and cling to Thee— 
 I am longing for Thy favor. 
 When Thou comest, call for me,
[v4]
 Pass me not, O mighty Spirit! 
 Thou canst make the blind to see; 
 Witnesser of Jesus’ merit, 
 Speak the word of pow’r to me,
[v5]
 Love of God, so pure and changeless!
 Blood of Christ, so rich and free!
 Grace of God, so strong and boundless!
 Magnify them all in me.
[v6]
 Pass me not; but pardon bringing
 Bind my heart, O Lord, to Thee:
 While the streams of life are springing,
 Blessing others, oh, bless me.
[c1]
 Even me, even me, 
 Let some drops now fall on me.
