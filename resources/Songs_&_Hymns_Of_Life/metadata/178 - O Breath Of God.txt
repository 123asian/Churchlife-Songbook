[v1]
 O breath of God, breathe on us now, 
 And move within us while we pray: 
 The Spring of our new life art Thou, 
 The very light of our new day.
[v2]
 O strangely art Thou with us, Lord, 
 Neither in height nor depth to seek; 
 In nearness shall Thy voice be heard; 
 Spirit to spirit Thou dost speak.
[v3]
 Christ is our Advocate on high; 
 Thou art our Advocate within; 
 O plead the truth, and make reply 
 To every argument of sin.
[v4]
 But ah, this faithless heart of mine,
 The way I know, I know my Guide;
 Forgive me, O my Friend divine, 
 That I so often turn aside.
[v5]
 Be with me when no other friend
 The mystâ€™ry of my heart can share;
 And be Thou known, when fears transcend,
 By Thy best name of Comforter.
