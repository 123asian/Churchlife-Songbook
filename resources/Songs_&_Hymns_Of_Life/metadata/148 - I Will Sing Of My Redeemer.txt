[v1]
 I will sing of my Redeemer, 
 And His wondrous love to me; 
 On the cruel cross He suffered, 
 From the curse to set me free. 
[v2]
 I will tell the wondrous story, 
 How my lost estate to save,  
 In His boundless love and mercy, 
 He the ransom freely gave.
[v3]
 I will praise my dear Redeemer, 
 His triumphant pow’r I’ll tell,  
 How the victory He giveth
 Over sin, and death and hell.
[v4]
 I will sing of my Redeemer, 
 And His heav’nly love to me; 
 He from death to life hath brought me, 
 Son of God with Him to be.
[c1]
 Sing, O sing of my Redeemer, 
 With His blood He purchased me; 
 On the cross He sealed my pardon, 
 Paid the debt and made me free.
