[v1]
 Onward Christian soldiers! 
 Marching as to war, 
 With the cross of Jesus 
 Going on before. 
 Christ, the royal Master, 
 Leads against the foe; 
 Forward into battle, 
 See, His banners go! 
[v2]
 At the name of Jesus 
 Satan’s host doth flee; 
 On then, Christian soldiers, 
 On to victory! 
 Hell’s foundations quiver 
 At the shout of praise: 
 Brothers, lift your voices, 
 Loud your anthems raise!
[v3]
 Like a mighty army 
 Moves the church of God: 
 Brothers, we are treading 
 Where the saints have trod; 
 We are not divided, 
 All one body we— 
 One in faith and Spirit, 
 One eternally.
[v4]
 Crowns and thrones may perish,
 Kingdoms rise and wane;
 But the Church of Jesus
 Constant will remain.
 Gates of hell can never
 ’Gainst the Church prevail;
 We have Christ’s own promise,
 Which can never fail.
[v5]
 Onward, then, ye people!
 Join our happy throng;
 Blend with ours your voices
 In the triumph song.
 Glory, laud and honor
 Unto Christ, the King;
 This through countless ages
 Men and angels sing.
[c1]
 Onward, Christian soldiers! 
 Marching as to war, 
 With the cross of Jesus, 
 Going on before.
