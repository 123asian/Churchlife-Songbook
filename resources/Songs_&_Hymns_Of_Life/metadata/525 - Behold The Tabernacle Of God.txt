[V1]
Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, 
 And He will dwell with them, 
and they shall be His people, 
 And God Himself shall be with them 
and be their God. 
 Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, 
 ||And God shall wipe away all tears
from their eyes; 
 And there shall be no more death,
neither sorrow, 
 nor crying, neither shall there be
any more pain, 
 For the former things are passed away. 
 Behold, I make all things new.
