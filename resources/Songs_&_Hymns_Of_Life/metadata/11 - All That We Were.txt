[v1]
 All that we were— our sin, our guilt, 
 Our death— was all our own:
 All that we are we owe to Thee, 
 Thou God of grace alone.
[v2]
 Thy mercy found us in our sins, 
 And gave us to believe; 
 Then, in believing, peace we found, 
 And in Thy Christ we live.
[v3]
 All that we are, as saints on earth, 
 All that we hope to be, 
 When Jesus comes and glory dawns, 
 We owe it all to Thee.
[v4]
 O God, how rich, how vast Thy love,
 Whoe’er can Thee repay?
 Thy love is past man’s finding out, 
 Thy grace no man can say.
[v5]
 But Lord, to me I pray Thee grant,
 More clearly may I see,
 That I may e’er more fully know
 How much I owe to Thee.
[v6]
 But if man’s heart should e’er suppose
 He could repay Thy love,
 It only means he nothing knows
 Of love, all loves above.
[v7]
 So may we never bargains make
 With that dear love of Thine:
 The love that made Thine heart once break,
 Whoe’er that love could win?
[v8]
 Then nevermore suggest return,
 His love is far too high;
 But let our hearts with rapture burn
 That He for us should die.
[v9]
 O Father God, we owe Thee all!
 All that we are and have!
 With grateful thanks before Thee fall,
 ’Tis all that we can give.
