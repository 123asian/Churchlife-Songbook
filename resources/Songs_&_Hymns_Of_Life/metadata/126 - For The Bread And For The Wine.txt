[v1]
 For the bread and for the wine, 
 For the pledge that seals Him mine, 
 For the words of love divine, 
 We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
[v2]
 Only bread and only wine, 
 Yet to faith, the solemn sign 
 Of the heav’nly and divine! 
 We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
[v3]
 For the words that turn our eye 
 To the cross of Calvary, 
 Bidding us in faith draw nigh, 
 We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
[v4]
 For the words that fragrance breathe 
 These plain symbols underneath, 
 Words that His own peace bequeath, 
 We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
[v5]
 For Thy words in Spirit shown,
 For Thy will to us made known,
 “Do ye this until I come,”
 We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
[v6]
 Till He come we take the bread,
 Type of Him on whom we feed,
 Him who liveth and was dead!
 We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
[v7]
 Till He come we take the cup;
 As we at His table sup,
 Eye and heart are lifted up!
 We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
[v8]
 For that coming, here foreshown,
 For that day to man unknown,
 For the glory and the throne,
 We give Thee thanks, O Lord.
