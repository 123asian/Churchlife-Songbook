[v1]
 Jesus, Savior, Son of God, 
 Bearer of the sinner’s load, 
 Breaker of the captive’s chain, 
 Cleanser of the guilty’s stain,
[v2]
 Thou the sinner’s death hast died, 
 Thou for us was crucified; 
 For our sins Thy flesh was torn, 
 Thou our penalty hast borne.
[v3]
 Savior, Surety, Lamb of God, 
 Thou hast bought us with Thy blood; 
 Thou hast wiped the debt away, 
 Nothing left for us to pay;
[v4]
 Nothing left for us to bear, 
 Nothing left for us to share 
 But the pardon and the bliss, 
 But the love, the light, the peace.
[v5]
 I to Thee will look and live,
 And, in looking, praises give;
 Looking lightens, looking heals,
 Looking all the gladness seals.
[v6]
 Jesus, Savior, Son of God,
 Bearer of the sinner’s load,
 I would rise to Thee above,
 I would look, and praise, and love.
