[v1]
 Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty! 
 Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee; 
 Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty! 
 God in three persons, blessed Trinity!
[v2]
 Holy, holy, holy! All the saints adore Thee; 
 Heaven’s elders cast their crowns down by the glassy sea; 
 Cherubim and seraphim worship too before Thee, 
 Who was, and is, and evermore shall be.
[v3]
 Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide Thee, 
 Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see, 
 Only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee, 
 Perfect in pow’r, in love, and purity.
[v4]
 Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty! 
 All Thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth, and sky, and sea; 
 Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty! 
 God in three persons, blessed Trinity!
