[v1]
 Rock of Ages, cleft for me, 
 Let me hide myself in Thee; 
 Let the water and the blood, 
 From Thy wounded side which flowed, 
 Be of sin the double cure, 
 Save me from its guilt and pow’r.
[v2]
 Not the labor of my hands 
 Can fulfill Thy law’s demands; 
 Could my zeal no respite know, 
 Could my tears forever flow, 
 All could never sin erase, 
 Thou must save, and save by grace.
[v3]
 Nothing in my hands I bring, 
 Simply to Thy cross I cling; 
 Naked, come to Thee for dress; 
 Helpless, look to Thee for grace; 
 Foul, I to the fountain fly; 
 Wash me, Savior, or I die.
[v4]
 While I draw this fleeting breath, 
 When mine eyes shall close in death, 
 When I soar to worlds unknown, 
 See Thee on Thy judgment throne, 
 Rock of Ages, cleft for me, 
 Let me hide myself in Thee.
