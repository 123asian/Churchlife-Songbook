[v1]
 Dear Savior, Thou art mine, 
 How sweet the thought to me; 
 Let me repeat Thy name, 
 And lift my heart to Thee. 
[v2]
 Thou art the sinner’s friend, 
 So I Thy friendship claim, 
 A sinner saved by grace, 
 When Thy sweet message came.
[v3]
 My hardened heart was touched; 
 Thy pard’ning voice I heard; 
 And joy and peace came in 
 While list’ning to Thy word.
[v4]
 So let me sing Thy praise, 
 So let me call Thee mine. 
 I cannot doubt Thy word, 
 I know that I am Thine.
[c1]
 Mine! Mine! Mine!
 I know Thou art mine; 
 Savior, dear Savior, 
 I know Thou art mine.
