[v1]
 We praise Thee, O God, for the Son of Thy love, 
 For our Savior who died and is now gone above. 
 Hallelujah! Thine the glory, Hallelujah! Amen; 
 Hallelujah! Thine the glory, Revive us again.
[v2]
 We praise Thee, O God, for Thy Spirit of light, 
 Who has shown us our Savior, and scattered our night.
 Hallelujah! Thine the glory, Hallelujah! Amen; 
 Hallelujah! Thine the glory, Revive us again.
[v3]
 All glory and praise to the Lamb that was slain, 
 Who has borne all our sins, and doth cleanse every stain.
 Hallelujah! Thine the glory, Hallelujah! Amen; 
 Hallelujah! Thine the glory, Revive us again.
[v4]
 Revive us again; fill each heart with Thy love, 
 May each soul be rekindled with fire from above.
 Hallelujah! Thine the glory, Hallelujah! Amen; 
 Hallelujah! Thine the glory, Revive us again.
