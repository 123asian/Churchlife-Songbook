[v1]
 Fade, fade each earthly joy; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 Break every tender tie; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 Dark is the wilderness, 
 Earth has no resting place, 
 Jesus alone can bless; 
 Jesus is mine.
[v2]
 Tempt not my soul away; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 Here would I ever stay; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 Perishing things of clay, 
 Born but for one brief day, 
 Pass from my heart away; 
 Jesus is mine.
[v3]
 Farewell, ye dreams of night; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 Lost in this dawning bright; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 All that my soul has tried 
 Left but a dismal void; 
 Jesus has satisfied; 
 Jesus is mine.
[v4]
 Farewell, mortality; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 Welcome, eternity; 
 Jesus is mine. 
 Welcome, O loved and blest, 
 Welcome, sweet scenes of rest, 
 Welcome, my Saviorâ€™s breast; 
 Jesus is mine.
