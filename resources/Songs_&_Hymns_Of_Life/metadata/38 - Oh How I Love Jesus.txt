[v1]
 There is a name I love to hear, 
 I love to sing its worth; 
 It sounds like music in mine ear, 
 The sweetest name on earth.  
[v2]
 It tells me of a Savior’s love, 
 Who died to set me free;
 It tells me of His precious blood, 
 The sinner’s perfect plea.
[v3]
 It tells me what my Father hath, 
 In store for every day, 
 And though I tread a darksome path, 
 Yields sunshine all the way.
[v4]
 It tells of One whose loving heart 
 Can feel my deepest woe, 
 Who in each sorrow bears a part, 
 That none can bear below.
[c1]
 Oh, how I love Jesus, 
 Oh, how I love Jesus, 
 Oh, how I love Jesus, 
 Because He first loved me!
