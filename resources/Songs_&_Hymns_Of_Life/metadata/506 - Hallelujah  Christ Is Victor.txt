[v1]
 Hallelujah! Christ is Victor, 
 Tell with every breath, 
 That the Savior still is conqu’ror 
 Over sin and death. 
[v2]
 Hallelujah! Christ is Victor, 
 Pain and sickness flee, 
 When we plead the mighty vict’ry 
 Won on Calvary.
[v3]
 Hallelujah! Christ is Victor, 
 Therefore do and dare; 
 Go wherever Jesus sends you 
 In prevailing prayer.
[v4]
 Hallelujah! Christ is Victor,
 No defeat nor fear
 Evermore must dim thy vision!
 Christ the way will clear.
[v5]
 Hallelujah! Christ is Victor
 Soon His voice shall ring,
 “Come ye conqu’rors, come up hither,
 Join thy conqu’ring King.”
[c1]
 Hallelujah! Christ is Victor, 
 Tell where’er you go, 
 That the Lord is still the conqu’ror, 
 Over every foe.
