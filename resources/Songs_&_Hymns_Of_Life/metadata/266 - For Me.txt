[v1]
 Under an eastern sky, 
 Amid a rabble’s cry, 
 A Man went forth to die, 
 For me! for me!
[v2]
 Thorn-crowned His blessed head, 
 Bloodstained His every tread; 
 Cross-laden He was led, 
 For me! for me!
[v3]
 Pierced His hands and feet, 
 Three hours o’er Him beat 
 Fierce rays of noontide heat, 
 For me! for me!
[v4]
 Thus wert Thou made all mine; 
 Lord, make me wholly Thine; 
 Grant grace and strength divine 
 To me! to me!
[v5]
 In thought and word and deed, 
 Thy will to do, O lead 
 My soul, e’en though it bleed, 
 To Thee, To Thee.
