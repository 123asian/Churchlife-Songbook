[v1]
 Come, Thou Almighty King, 
 Help us Thy name to sing, 
 Help us to praise! 
 Father, all glorious, 
 O’er all victorious! 
 Come, and reign over us, 
 Ancient of Days.
[v2]
 Come, Thou incarnate Word, 
 Gird on Thy might y sword— 
 Our prayer attend! 
 Come! and Thy people bless, 
 And give Thy word success; 
 Spirit of holiness, On us descend!
[v3]
 Come, holy Comforter, 
 Thy sacred witness bear 
 In this glad hour! 
 Thou who Almighty art, 
 Now rule in every heart, 
 And ne’er from us depart, 
 Spirit of power!
[v4]
 To Thee, great One in Three, 
 Eternal praises be 
 Hence— evermore: 
 Thy sov’reign majesty 
 May we in glory see, 
 And to eternity 
 Love and adore!
