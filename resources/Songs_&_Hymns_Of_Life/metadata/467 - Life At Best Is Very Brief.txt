[v1]
 Life at best is very brief, 
 Like the falling of a leaf, 
 Like the binding of a sheaf, 
 Be in time! 
 Fleeting days are telling fast 
 That the die will soon be cast, 
 And the fatal line be passed, 
 Be in time! 
[v2]
 Fairest flowers soon decay, 
 Youth and beauty pass away; 
 Oh, you have not long to stay, 
 Be in time! 
 While Godâ€™s Spirit bids you come, 
 Sinner, do not longer roam, 
 Lest you seal your hopeless doom, 
 Be in time!
[v3]
 Time is gliding swiftly by, 
 Death and judgment draweth nigh, 
 To the arms of Jesus fly, 
 Be in time! 
 Oh, I pray you count the cost! 
 Ere the fatal line be crossed, 
 And your soul in hell be lost, 
 Be in time!
[v4]
 Sinner, heed the warning voice, 
 Make the Lord your final choice, 
 Then all heaven will rejoice, 
 Be in time! 
 Come from darkness into light; 
 Come, let Jesus make you right; 
 Come, receive His life tonight, 
 Be in time!
[c1]
 Be in time! Be in time! 
 While the voice of Jesus calls you, 
 Be in time! 
 If in sin you longer wait, 
 You may find no open gate, 
 And your cry be just too late: 
 Be in time!
