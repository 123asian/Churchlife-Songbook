[v1]
 Naught have I gotten but what I received; 
 Grace hath bestowed it since I have believed; 
 Boasting excluded, pride I abase; 
 I’m only a sinner saved by grace! 
[v2]
 Once I was foolish, and sin ruled my heart, 
 Causing my footsteps from God to depart; 
 Jesus hath found me, happy my case; 
 I now am a sinner saved by grace!
[v3]
 Tears unavailing, no merit had I; 
 Mercy had saved me, or else I must die; 
 Sin had alarmed me, fearing God’s face; 
 But now I’m a sinner saved by grace!
[v4]
 Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows, 
 Loving his Savior to tell what he knows; 
 Once more to tell it, would I embrace— 
 I’m only a sinner saved by grace!
[c1]
 Only a sinner saved by grace! 
 Only a sinner saved by grace! 
 This is my story, to God be the glory— 
 I’m only a sinner saved by grace!
