[V1]
 God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus, 
 He came to love, heal, and forgive; 
 He lived and died to buy my pardon, 
 An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives. 
[V2]
 How sweet to hold a newborn baby, 
 And feel the pride, and joy he gives; 
 But greater still the calm assurance, 
 This child can face uncertain days because He lives.
[V3]
 And then one day I’ll cross the river,
 I’ll fight life’s final war with pain; 
 And then as death gives way to vict’ry, 
 I’ll see the lights of glory and I’ll know He reigns.
[C1]
 Because He lives I can face tomorrow, 
 Because He lives all fear is gone; 
 Because I know He holds the future. 
 And life is worth the living just because He lives.
