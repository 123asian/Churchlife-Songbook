[v1]
 The Church’s one foundation 
 Is Jesus Christ her Lord; 
 She is His new creation 
 By water and the Word: 
 From heav’n He came and sought her 
 To be His holy Bride; 
 With His own blood He bought her, 
 And for her life He died.
[v2]
 She is from every nation, 
 Yet one o’er all the earth, 
 Her charter of salvation, 
 One Lord, one faith, one birth; 
 One holy Name she blesses, 
 Partakes one holy food, 
 And to one hope she presses, 
 With every grace endued.
[v3]
 ’Mid toil and tribulation, 
 And tumult of her war, 
 She waits the consummation 
 Of peace for evermore; 
 Till, with the vision glorious, 
 Her longing eyes are blest, 
 And the great Church victorious 
 Shall be the Church at rest.
[v4]
 Yet she on earth hath union 
 With God the Three in One, 
 And mystic sweet communion 
 With those whose rest is won: 
 O happy ones and holy! 
 Lord, give us grace that we, 
 Like them, the meek and lowly, 
 On high may dwell with Thee.
