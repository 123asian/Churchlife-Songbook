[v1]
 Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious; 
 See the Man of sorrows now; 
 From the fight returned victorious, 
 Every knee to Him shall bow; 
 Crown Him! Crown Him! 
 Crown Him! Crown Him! 
 Crowns become the Victor’s brow.
[v2]
 Crown the Savior! Angels, crown Him! 
 Rich the trophies Jesus brings; 
 In the seat of pow’r enthrone Him, 
 While the vault of heaven rings: 
 Crown Him! Crown Him! 
 Crown Him! Crown Him! 
 Crown the Savior King of kings.
[v3]
 Sinners in derision crowned Him, 
 Mocking thus the Savior’s claim; 
 Saints and angels crowd around Him, 
 Own His title, praise His name: 
 Crown Him! Crown Him! 
 Crown Him! Crown Him! 
 Spread abroad the Victor’s fame.
[v4]
 Hark! those bursts of acclamation! 
 Hark! those loud triumphant chords! 
 Jesus takes the highest station; 
 O what joy the sight affords! 
 Crown Him! Crown Him! 
 Crown Him! Crown Him! 
 King of kings, and Lord of lords!
