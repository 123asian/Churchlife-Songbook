[v1]
 How sweet is the story of Christ’s boundless love, 
 That brought Him to suffer from glory above! 
 He died in our stead upon Calvary’s tree,
 Obtaining redemption that we might be free. 
[v2]
 How wondrous the story! The law’s holy claims 
 Were met by the blood which redemption proclaims. 
 The judgment of sin has been borne by the Son, 
 Who glorified God in the work He has done.
[v3]
 How brilliant the glory where Christ is enthroned 
 How rightly His name above others is owned! 
 Yes, Jesus, the Savior, the glory crowned Lord, 
 Is worthy by all to be ever adored.
[c1]
 Sound His praise! Sound His praise! 
 All the work has been done; 
 Praise His name! Praise His name! 
 Jesus, God’s blessed Son. 
 We give Him the glory, our Savior and Friend; 
 Our song is of Jesus and never will end.
