[v1]
 ’Tis my happiness below 
 Not to live without the cross; 
 But the Savior’s pow’r to know, 
 Sanctifying every loss.
[v2]
 Trials must and will befall; 
 But with humble faith to see 
 Love inscribed upon them all— 
 This is happiness to me.
[v3]
 Did I meet no trials here, 
 No chastisement by the way, 
 Might I not, with reason, fear 
 I should prove a castaway?
[v4]
 Trials make the promise sweet; 
 Trials give new life to prayer; 
 Bring me to my Savior’s feet, 
 Lay me low and keep me there.
