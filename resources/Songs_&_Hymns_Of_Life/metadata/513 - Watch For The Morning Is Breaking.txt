[v1]
 Watch! for the morning is breaking, 
 A moment, and He will be here! 
 The mists and the shadows are fleeing, 
 The darkness will soon disappear; 
 And He, for whom ages have waited, 
 The Lord Who has tarried so long, 
 Will come in an outburst of glory, 
 A moment, and we shall be gone.
[v2]
 Watch! for the morning is breaking, 
 A moment, the crown will be won! 
 A moment, and we shall be with Him, 
 A moment, the journey is done! 
 Lord, keep us each moment unsleeping, 
 And count us all worthy to be 
 In that noble band of Thy watchers, 
 Whose life is a vigil with Thee.
