[v1]
 O, the bitter shame and sorrow, 
 That a time could ever be, 
 When I let the Savior’s pity 
 Plead in vain, and proudly answered, 
 “All of self, and none of Thee, 
 All of self, and none of Thee.”
[v2]
 Yet He found me; I beheld Him 
 Bleeding on the cursèd tree;
 Heard Him pray, “Forgive them, Father!” 
 And my wistful heart said faintly, 
 “Some of self, and some of Thee, 
 Some of self, and some of Thee.”
[v3]
 Day by day His tender mercy, 
 Healing, helping, full and free, 
 Sweet and strong, and ah! so patient, 
 Brought me lower while I whispered, 
 “Less of self, and more of Thee, 
 Less of self, and more of Thee.”
[v4]
 Higher than the highest heavens, 
 Deeper than the deepest sea,
 Lord, Thy love at last hath conquered; 
 Grant me now my heart’s petition, 
 “None of self, and all of Thee, 
 None of self, and all of Thee.”
