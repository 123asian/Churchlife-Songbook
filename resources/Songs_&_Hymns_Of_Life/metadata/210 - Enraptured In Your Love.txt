[v1]
 Enraptured in Your love— how fresh and new! 
 Infuse me with Your love— sweeter, fresher than dew! 
 Your love (embrace me close) does forward guide; 
 I revel in Your love, on Your breast abide. 
 How I yearn, O Lord, to delight in love,
 By Your love o’ershadow me. 
 A banner over me: Your love— Yourself, 
 For Your love and Yourself are one.
[v2]
 You are my dearest One, my only Love. 
 Yes, Lord, now You alone are the object of love.
 If You redemption give and only love, 
 I know my heart won’t be fully satisfied. 
 How I yearn, dear Lord, Your own self to gain, 
 For I know it’s only You. 
 It’s You that I pursue, and You are love; 
 My sole Treasure You are to me.
