[v1]
 In the heart of Jesus there is love for you, 
 Love most pure and tender, love most deep and true; 
 Why should you be lonely, why for friendship sigh, 
 When the heart of Jesus has a full supply?
[v2]
 In the mind of Jesus there is thought for you, 
 Warm as summer sunshine, sweet as morning dew; 
 Why should you be fearful, why take anxious thought, 
 Since the mind of Jesus cares for those He bought?
[v3]
 In the field of Jesus there is work for you; 
 Such as even angels might rejoice to do; 
 Why stand idly sighing for some lifework grand, 
 While the field of Jesus seeks your reaping hand?
[v4]
 In the church of Jesus there’s a place for you; 
 Glorious, bright, and joyous, right and peaceful too; 
 Why then, like a wand’rer, roam with weary pace, 
 If the church of Jesus holds for you a place?
