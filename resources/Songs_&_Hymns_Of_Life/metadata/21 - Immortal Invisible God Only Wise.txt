[v1]
 Immortal, invisible, God only wise, 
 In light inaccessible hid from our eyes, 
 Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days, 
 Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.
[v2]
 Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light, 
 Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might; 
 Thy justice like mountains high soaring above, 
 Thy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love.
[v3]
 To all life Thou givest, to both great and small; 
 In all life Thou livest, the true life of all; 
 We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree, 
 And wither and perish, but nought changeth Thee.
[v4]
 Great Father of Glory, pure Father of Light,
 Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;
 All praise we would render, O help us to see:
 â€™Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee.  
[v5]
 Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
 In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
 Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
 Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.
