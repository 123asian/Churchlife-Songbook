[v1]
 Holy Spirit, Truth divine, 
 Dawn upon this soul of mine; 
 Word of God, and inward light  
 Wake my spirit, clear my sight,  
 Wake my spirit, clear my sight.
[v2]
 Holy Spirit, Love divine, 
 Glow within this heart of mine; 
 Kindle every high desire; 
 Perish self in Thy pure fire,  
 Perish self in Thy pure fire.
[v3]
 Holy Spirit, Pow’r divine, 
 Fill and nerve this will of mine; 
 Grant that may I strongly live,  
 Bravely bear, and nobly strive,  
 Bravely bear, and nobly strive.
[v4]
 Holy Spirit, Peace divine,
 Still this restless heart of mine; 
 Speak to calm this tossing sea,
 Stayed in Thy tranquility
[v5]
 Holy Spirit, Joy divine,
 Gladden Thou this heart of mine;
 In the desert ways I sing,
 “Spring, O Well, forever spring.”
