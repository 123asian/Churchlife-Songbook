[v1]
 Holy Ghost, with light divine, 
 Shine upon this heart of mine; 
 Chase the shade of night away; 
 Turn my darkness into day.
[v2]
 Let me see my Savior's face, 
 Let me all His beauties trace; 
 Show those glorious truths to me 
 Which are only known to Thee.
[v3]
 Holy Ghost, with pow’r divine, 
 Cleanse this guilty heart of mine; 
 Long has sin, without control, 
 Held dominion o’er my soul.
[v4]
 Holy Ghost, with joy divine, 
 Cheer this saddened heart of mine; 
 Bid my many woes depart, 
 Heal my wounded, bleeding heart.
[v5]
 Holy Spirit, all divine,
 Dwell within this heart of mine;
 Cast down every idol throne,
 Reign supreme, and reign alone.
[v6]
 See, to Thee I yield my heart,
 Shed Thy life through every part;
 A pure temple I would be,
 Wholly dedicate to Thee.
