[v1]
 Jesus, my sorrow lies too deep 
 For human ministry; 
 It knows not how to tell itself 
 To any but to Thee.
[v2]
 Thou dost remember still, amid 
 The glories of God’s throne, 
 The sorrows of mortality, 
 For they were once Thine own.
[v3]
 Jesus, my fainting spirit brings 
 Its fearfulness to Thee. 
 Thine eye, at least, can penetrate 
 The clouded mystery.
[v4]
 And is it not, O Lord, enough, 
 This holy sympathy? 
 There is no sorrow e’er so deep
 But I may bring to Thee.
