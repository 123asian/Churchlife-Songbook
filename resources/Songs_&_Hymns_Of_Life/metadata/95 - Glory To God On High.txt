[v1]
 Glory to God on high! 
 Let praises fill the sky! 
 Praise ye His name! 
 He all our sorrows bore; 
 Angels His name adore, 
 And saints cry evermore, 
 “Worthy the Lamb!”
[v2]
 All they around the throne 
 Cheerfully join in one, 
 Praising His name: 
 We who have known His blood 
 Sealing our peace with God, 
 Spread His dear name abroad; 
 Worthy the Lamb!  
[v3]
 Join all the human race, 
 Our Lord and God to bless, 
 Praise ye His name! 
 In Him we will rejoice, 
 Making a cheerful noise, 
 Saying with heart and voice, 
 “Worthy the Lamb!”
[v4]
 Though we must change our place, 
 Our hearts shall never cease
 Praising His name: 
 To Him we’ll tribute bring, 
 Laud Him, our gracious King, 
 And, without ceasing, sing, 
 “Worthy the Lamb!”
