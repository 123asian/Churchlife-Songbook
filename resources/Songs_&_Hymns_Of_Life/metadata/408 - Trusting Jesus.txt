[v1]
 Simply trusting every day; 
 Trusting through a stormy way; 
 Even when my faith is small, 
 Trusting Jesus, that is all. 
[v2]
 Brightly does His Spirit shine 
 Into this poor heart of mine; 
 While He leads I cannot fall, 
 Trusting Jesus, that is all.
[v3]
 Singing if my way be clear, 
 Praying if the path be drear; 
 If in danger, for Him call, 
 Trusting Jesus, that is all.
[v4]
 Trusting Him while life shall last, 
 Trusting Him till earth is past, 
 Till within the jasper wall, 
 Trusting Jesus, that is all.
[c1]
 Trusting as the moments fly, 
 Trusting as the days go by, 
 Trusting Him, whateâ€™er befall, 
 Trusting Jesus, that is all.
