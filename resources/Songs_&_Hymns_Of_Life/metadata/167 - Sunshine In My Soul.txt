[v1]
 There is sunshine in my soul today, 
 More glorious and bright 
 Than glows in any earthly sky, 
 For Jesus is my light. 
[v2]
 There is music in my soul today, 
 A carol to my King; 
 And Jesus, listening, can hear 
 The song I cannot sing.
[v3]
 There is springtime in my soul today, 
 For when the Lord is near, 
 The dove of peace sings in my heart, 
 The flow’rs of grace appear.
[v4]
 There is gladness in my soul today, 
 And hope, and praise, and love, 
 For blessings which He gives me now, 
 For joys “laid up” above.
[c1]
 O there’s sunshine, blessed sunshine, 
 While the peaceful, happy moments roll; 
 When Jesus shows His smiling face 
 There is sunshine in my soul.
