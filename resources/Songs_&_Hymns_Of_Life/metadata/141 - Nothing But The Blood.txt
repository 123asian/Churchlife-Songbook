[v1]
 Your blood speaks a better word 
 than all the empty claims 
 I’ve heard upon this earth, 
 speaks righteousness for me, 
 and stands in my defense; 
 Jesus it’s Your blood. 
[v2]
 Your cross testifies in grace,
 tells of the Father’s heart 
 to make a way for us. 
 Now boldly we approach; 
 not earthly confidence, 
 it’s only by Your blood.
[c1]
 What can wash away our sin? 
 What can make us whole again? 
 Nothing but the blood, 
 nothing but the blood of Jesus. 
 What can wash us pure as snow, 
 welcomed as the friends of God? 
 Nothing but Your blood, 
 nothing but Your blood, King Jesus.
