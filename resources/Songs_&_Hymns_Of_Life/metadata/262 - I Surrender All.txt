[v1]
 All to Jesus I surrender, 
 All to Him I freely give; 
 I will ever love and trust Him, 
 In His presence daily live. 
[v2]
 All to Jesus I surrender, 
 Humbly at His feet I bow, 
 Worldly pleasures all forsaken; 
 Take me, Jesus, take me now.
[v3]
 All to Jesus I surrender, 
 Make me, Savior, wholly Thine; 
 Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit, 
 Truly know that Thou art mine.
[v4]
 All to Jesus I surrender,
 Lord, I give myself to Thee;
 Fill me with Thy love and power,
 Let Thy blessing fall on me.
[v5]
 All to Jesus I surrender,
 Now I feel the sacred flame.
 Oh, the joy of full salvation!
 Glory, glory to His name!
[c1]
 I surrender all, I surrender all. 
 All to Thee, my blessed Savior, 
 I surrender all.
