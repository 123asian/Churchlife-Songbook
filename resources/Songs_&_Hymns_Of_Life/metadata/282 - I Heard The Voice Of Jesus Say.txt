[v1]
 I heard the voice of Jesus say, 
 “Come unto Me, and rest; 
 Lay down, thou weary one, lay down 
 Thy head upon My breast.”
 I came to Jesus as I was, 
 Weary, and worn, and sad; 
 I found in Him a resting place, 
 And He has made me glad.
[v2]
 I heard the voice of Jesus say, 
 “Behold, I freely give 
 The living water; thirsty one, 
 Stoop down, and drink, and live.
 ” I came to Jesus, and I drank 
 Of that life-giving stream; 
 My thirst was quenched, my soul revived, 
 And now I live in Him.
[v3]
 I heard the voice of Jesus say,
 “I am this dark world’s Light;
 Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise, 
 And all thy day be bright.” 
 I looked to Jesus, and I found 
 In Him my Star, my Sun; 
 And in that Light of life I’ll walk 
 Till trav’ling days are done.
