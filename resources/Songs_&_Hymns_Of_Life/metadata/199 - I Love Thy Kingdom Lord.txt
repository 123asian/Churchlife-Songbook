[v1]
 I love Thy kingdom, Lord, 
 The house of Thine abode, 
 The Church our blest Redeemer bought 
 With His own precious blood.
[v2]
 I love Thy Church, O God! 
 Her walls before Thee stand, 
 Dear as the apple of Thine eye 
 And graven on Thy hand.
[v3]
 For her my tears shall fall, 
 For her my prayers ascend; 
 To her my cares and toils be givâ€™n 
 Till toils and cares shall end.
[v4]
 Beyond my highest joy
 I prize her heavenly ways,
 Her sweet communion, solemn vows,
 Her hymns of love and praise.
[v5]
 Sure as Thy truth shall last,
 To Zion shall be given
 The brightest glories earth can yield
 And brighter bliss of heaven.
