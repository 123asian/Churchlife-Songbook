[v1]
 Once it was the blessing, 
 Now it is the Lord; 
 Once it was the feeling, 
 Now it is His Word;  
 Once His gift I wanted, 
 Now the Giver own; 
 Once I sought for healing, 
 Now Himself alone. 
[v2]
 Once ’twas painful trying,
 Now ’tis perfect trust; 
 Once a half salvation, 
 Now the uttermost; 
 Once ’twas ceaseless holding, 
 Now He holds me fast;
 Once ’twas constant drifting, 
 Now my anchor’s cast.
[v3]
 Once ’twas busy planning, 
 Now ’tis trustful prayer; 
 Once ’twas anxious caring, 
 Now He has the care; 
 Once ’twas what I wanted, 
 Now what Jesus says; 
 Once ’twas constant asking, 
 Now ’tis ceaseless praise.
[v4]
 Once it was my working,
 His it hence shall be;
 Once I tried to use Him,
 Now He uses me;
 Once the pow’r I wanted,
 Now the Mighty One;
 Once for self I labored,
 Now for Him alone.
[v5]
 Once I hoped in Jesus,
 Now I know He’s mine;
 Once my lamps were dying,
 Now they brightly shine;
 Once for death I waited,
 Now His coming hail;
 And my hopes are anchored
 Safe within the veil.
[c1]
 All in all forever, 
 Only Christ I’ll sing; 
 Everything is in Christ, 
 And Christ is everything.
