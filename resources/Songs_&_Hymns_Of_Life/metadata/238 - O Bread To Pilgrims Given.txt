[v1]
 O Bread to pilgrims given, 
 O Food for saints to eat, 
 O Manna sent from heaven, 
 For heav’n-born natures meet; 
 Give us, for Thee long pining, 
 To eat till richly filled; 
 Till, earth’s delights resigning, 
 Our every wish is stilled.
[v2]
 O Water, life bestowing, 
 Forth from the Savior’s heart, 
 A fountain purely flowing, 
 A fount of love Thou art. 
 Oh, let us, freely tasting, 
 Our burning thirst assuage; 
 Thy sweetness, never wasting,
 Avails from age to age.
[v3]
 Jesus, this feast receiving, 
 We Thee unseen adore; 
 Thy faithful word believing, 
 We take, and doubt no more. 
 Give us, Thou true and loving, 
 On earth to live in Thee; 
 Then, death the veil removing, 
 Thy glorious face to see.
