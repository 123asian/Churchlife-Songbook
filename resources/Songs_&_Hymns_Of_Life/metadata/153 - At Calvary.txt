[v1]
 Years I spent in vanity and pride, 
 Caring not my Lord was crucified, 
 Knowing not it was for me He died 
 On Calvary. 
[v2]
 By God’s Word at last my sin I learned; 
 Then I trembled at the law I’d spurned, 
 Till my guilty soul imploring turned 
 To Calvary.
[v3]
 Now I’ve giv’n to Jesus everything, 
 Now I gladly own Him as my King, 
 Now my raptured soul can only sing 
 Of Calvary.
[v4]
 Oh, the love that drew salvation’s plan! 
 Oh, the grace that brought it down to man! 
 Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span 
 At Calvary!
[c1]
 Mercy there was great, and grace was free; 
 Pardon there was multiplied to me; 
 There my burdened soul found liberty, 
 At Calvary.
