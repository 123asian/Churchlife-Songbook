[v1]
 Forward! be our watchword, 
 Steps and voices joined; 
 Seek the things before us, 
 Not a look behind; 
 Burns the fiery pillar 
 At our army’s head; 
 Who shall dream of shrinking, 
 By our Captain led? 
 Forward through the desert, 
 Through the toil and fight; 
 Heaven’s Kingdom waits us, 
 Forward into light.
[v2]
 Glories upon glories 
 Hath our God prepared, 
 By the souls that love Him, 
 One day to be shared: 
 Eye hath not beheld them, 
 Ear hath never heard; 
 Nor of these hath uttered 
 Thought or speech a word; 
 Forward, marching forward 
 Where the kingdom’s bright, 
 Till the veil be lifted, 
 Till our faith be sight!
