[v1]
 The Church is Christ’s deep longing 
 And His good pleasure, too. 
 His every word and action 
 Is made with her in view. 
 His heart’s love is established, 
 And naught can Him deter. 
 Before the earth’s foundation 
 His thoughts were filled with her.
[v2]
 The eve of all creation 
 He mused on His delight 
 And pondered every feature 
 Well-pleasing in His sight. 
 Creation sprang to being 
 Proclaiming far and wide
 A mind of depth unfathomed 
 Fixed on a glorious Bride.
[v3]
 And thus His will was ’stablished 
 His counterpart to gain. 
 This fixed and firm intention, 
 Eternally the same. 
 Though Sin should e’en beguile her, 
 Then mock her helpless state, 
 He never could forsake her, 
 His yearning ne’er abate.
[v4]
 But mercy richly flowed, for 
 His love was, oh, so vast, 
 As graciously He sought her 
 With kindness unsurpassed. 
 The love which gently drew her — 
 What mind can comprehend! 
 Laid down His life, an off’ring; 
 Sweet fragrance yet ascends.
[v5]
 And now in resurrection 
 To her He draws most near;  
 His own heart’s love He pours out 
 Into her heart so dear. 
 As she beholds her Bridegroom, 
 His glory floods her heart, 
 Till she, His bride, is raptured, 
 His longed-for counterpart.
