[v1]
 Amazing grace! How sweet the sound, 
 That saved a wretch like me! 
 I once was lost, but now am found, 
 Was blind, but now I see.
[v2]
 ’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, 
 And grace my fears relieved; 
 How precious did that grace appear 
 The hour I first believed!
[v3]
 The Lord has promised good to me,
 His word my hope secures; 
 He will my shield and portion be 
 As long as life endures.
[v4]
 When  we’ve been there ten thousand years, 
 Bright shining as the sun, 
 We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise 
 Than when we’d first begun.
