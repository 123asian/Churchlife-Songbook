[v1]
 We are never weary singing our eternal song: 
 Glory to God, hallelujah! 
 We would sing His praise forever with our spirit strong: 
 Glory to God, hallelujah! 
[v2]
 We are lost amid the rapture of redeeming love: 
 Glory to God, hallelujah! 
 We are seeking every moment all its grace to prove: 
 Glory to God, hallelujah!
[v3]
 We are going on to glory as the Lord has told: 
 Glory to God, hallelujah! 
 Where the King in all His beauty we shall soon behold: 
 Glory to God, hallelujah!
[v4]
 There we’ll sing His grace and mercy in a glad new song: 
 Glory to God, hallelujah! 
 There we’ll praise our glorious Savior with the blessed throng: 
 Glory to God, hallelujah!
[c1]
 O the children of the Lord have a wondrous song to sing, 
 For the Lord will by His grace many sons to glory bring. 
 We are going in that day to the presence of the King: 
 Glory to God, hallelujah!
