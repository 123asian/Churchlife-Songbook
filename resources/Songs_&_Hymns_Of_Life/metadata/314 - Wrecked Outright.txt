[v1]
 “Wrecked outright on Jesus’ breast”; 
 Only “wrecked” souls thus can sing; 
 Little boats that hug the shore, 
 Fearing what the storm may bring, 
 Never find on Jesus’ breast, 
 All that “wrecked” souls mean by rest.
[v2]
 “Wrecked outright!” So we lament; 
 But when storms have done their worst, 
 Then the soul, surviving all, 
 In eternal arms is nursed; 
 There to find that nought can move 
 One, embosomed in such love.
[v3]
 “Wrecked outright!” No more to own 
 E’en a craft to sail the sea; 
 Still a voyager, yet now 
 Anchored to Infinity; 
 Nothing left to do but fling 
 Care aside, and simply cling.
[v4]
 “Wrecked outright!” ’Twas purest gain, 
 Henceforth other craft can see 
 That the storm may be a boon, 
 That, however rough the sea, 
 God Himself doth watchful stand, 
 For the “wreck” is in His hand.
