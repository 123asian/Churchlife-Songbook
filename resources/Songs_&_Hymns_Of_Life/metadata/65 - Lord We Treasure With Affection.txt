[v1]
 Lord, we treasure with affection 
 All Thy path of sorrow here, 
 And those closing scenes of anguish 
 To our hearts Thyself endear.                          
[v2]
 Deep Thy sorrow then, Lord Jesus, 
 Deeper far than thought can reach; 
 Grief intense and suff’rings holy, 
 Far beyond all tongues to teach.
[v3]
 None could follow there, blest Savior, 
 When redemption’s work was done; 
 For those suff’rings, deep, unfathomed, 
 Were, Lord Jesus, Thine alone!
[v4]
 Thou didst measure then sin’s distance, 
 Darkness, wrath and curse were Thine; 
 Man-betrayed, by God forsaken; 
 Thus we learn Thy love divine!
[c1]
 We will praise Thee! We will praise Thee! 
 Praise Thee, Lord, for sinners slain! 
 Give Thee glory! Give Thee glory! 
 Give Thee glory for the life we gain!
