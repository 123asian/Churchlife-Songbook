[v1]
 I hear the Savior say, 
 “Thy strength indeed is small, 
 Child of weakness, watch and pray, 
 Find in Me thine all in all.” 
[v2]
 Lord, now indeed I find 
 Thy pow’r, and Thine alone, 
 Can change the leper’s spots, 
 And melt the heart of stone.
[v3]
 For nothing good have I 
 Whereby Thy grace to claim— 
 I’ll wash my garments white 
 In the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb.
[v4]
 And when, before the throne, 
 I stand in Him complete, 
 “Jesus died my soul to save,” 
 My lips shall still repeat.
[c1]
 Jesus paid it all, 
 All to Him I owe; 
 Sin had left a crimson stain, 
 He washed it white as snow.
