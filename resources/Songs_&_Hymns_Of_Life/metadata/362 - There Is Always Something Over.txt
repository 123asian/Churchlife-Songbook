[v1]
 There is always something over, 
 When we taste our gracious Lord; 
 Every cup He fills o’erfloweth, 
 Rich supply He doth afford. 
 Nothing narrow, nothing stinted, 
 Ever issued from His store; 
 To His own He gives full measure, 
 Running over evermore. 
 To His own He gives full measure, 
 Running over evermore. 
[v2]
 There is always something over, 
 When we, from the Father’s hand, 
 Take our portion with thanksgiving, 
 Praising for the things He planned. 
 Satisfaction, full and deep’ning, 
 All our need He doth supply, 
 When the heart has tasted Jesus 
 Its desires to satisfy. 
 When the heart has tasted Jesus 
 Its desires to satisfy. 
[v3]
 There is always something over, 
 When we share in all His love; 
 Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us, 
 Unscaled heights rise far above. 
 Human lips can never utter 
 All His wondrous tenderness. 
 We can only praise and wonder 
 And His Name forever bless.
 We can only praise and wonder 
 And His Name forever bless.
