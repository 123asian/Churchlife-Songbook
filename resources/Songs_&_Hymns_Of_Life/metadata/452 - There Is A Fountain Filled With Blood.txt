[v1]
 There is a fountain filled with blood 
 Drawn from Emmanuel’s veins; 
 And sinners, plunged beneath that flood, 
 Lose all their guilty stains: 
 Lose all their guilty stains, 
 Lose all their guilty stains; 
 And sinners plunged beneath that flood, 
 Lose all their guilty stains.
[v2]
 The dying thief rejoiced to see 
 That fountain in his day; 
 And there may I, though vile as he, 
 Wash all my sins away. 
 Wash all my sins away, 
 Wash all my sins away; 
 And there may I, though vile as he, 
 Wash all my sins away.
[v3]
 Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood 
 Shall never lose its pow’r, 
 Till all the ransomed ones of God 
 Be saved, to sin no more. 
 Be saved, to sin no more, 
 Be saved, to sin no more, 
 Till all the ransomed ones of God 
 Be saved, to sin no more.
[v4]
 E’er since by faith I saw the stream
 Thy flowing wounds supply,
 Redeeming love has been my theme,
 And shall be till I die.
 And shall be till I die,
 And shall be till I die,
 Redeeming love has been my theme,
 And shall be till I die.
[v5]
 When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
 Lies silent in the grave,
 Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
 I’ll sing Thy power to save.
 I’ll sing Thy power to save,
 I’ll sing Thy power to save,
 Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
 I’ll sing Thy power to save.
