[v1]
 Sweet feast of love divine! 
 ’Tis grace that makes us free  
 To feed upon this bread and wine, 
 In mem’ry, Lord, of Thee.
[v2]
 Here every welcome guest 
 Waits, Lord, from Thee to learn 
 The secrets of Thy Father’s breast, 
 And all Thy grace discern.
[v3]
 Here conscience ends its strife, 
 And faith delights to prove 
 The sweetness of the Bread of Life, 
 The fulness of Thy love.
[v4]
 That blood that flowed for sin 
 In symbol here we see, 
 And feel the blessed pledge within 
 That we are loved of Thee.
[v5]
 But if this glimpse of love
 Is so divinely sweet,
 What will it be, O Lord, above,
 Thy gladd’ning smile to meet!
[v6]
 To see Thee face to face,
 Thy perfect likeness wear,
 And all Thy ways of wondrous grace
 Through endless years declare.
