[v1]
 Fill Thou my life, O Lord my God, 
 In every part with praise, 
 That my whole being may proclaim 
 Thy being and Thy ways. 
 Not for the lip of praise alone, 
 Nor e’en the praising heart 
 I ask, but for a life made up 
 Of praise in every part!
[v2]
 Fill every part of me with praise; 
 Let all my being speak 
 Of Thee and of Thy love, O Lord, 
 Poor though I be and weak. 
 So shall Thou, Lord, from me, e’en me, 
 Receive the glory due; 
 And so shall I begin on earth 
 The song forever new.
[v3]
 So shall each fear, each fret, each care 
 Be turned into a song, 
 And every winding of the way 
 The echo shall prolong; 
 So shall no part of day or night   
 From sacredness be free; 
 But all my life, in every step 
 Be fellowship with Thee.
