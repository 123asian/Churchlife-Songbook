[v1]
 Cross of Christ lead onward, 
 Through the holy war;
 In this sign we conquer 
 Now and evermore. 
 Not of man the power, 
 Not to man the fame; 
 We are victors only 
 In our Leader’s name. 
[v2]
 Not with pomp and pageant,
 Not in earthly pride; 
 We must fight our battles 
 Like the Crucified. 
 Overcome by suff’ring, 
 Conquer through defeat; 
 Tried and tested daily 
 In the furnace heat. 
[v3]
 Kind, yet we are fighting, 
 Bold, yet humbly meek; 
 Resting while we’re working, 
 Strong, but ever weak. 
 Timid, though courageous, 
 Gaining as we give; 
 Crucified with Jesus, 
 Yet, in Him, we live.
[v4]
 By a cloud encompassed,
 Witnesses to prove,
 Saints, apostles, prophets,
 Precious ones we love;
 While “advance!” is sounding,
 Mounts the battle thrill.
 Cross of Christ! lead onward 
 Where the Captain will.
[v5]
 Marching in the pathway
 That the Master trod,
 Walks One daily with us
 Like the Son of God.
 To the end enduring,
 Armor ne’er laid down,
 Till the Cross leads upward
 To the blood-bought crown.
[c1]
 Cross of Christ! lead onward, 
 Through the holy war; 
 In this sign we conquer 
 Now and evermore.
