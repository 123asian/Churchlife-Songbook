[V1]
 Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine;  
 Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine! 
 Heir of salvation, purchase of God, 
 Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.
[V2]
 Perfect submission, perfect delight, 
 Visions of rapture now burst on my sight; 
 Angels descending bring from above 
 Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
[V3]
 Perfect submission, all is at rest, 
 I in my Savior am happy and blest; 
 Watching and waiting, looking above, 
 Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.
[C1]
 This is my story, this is my song, 
 Praising my Savior all the day long. 
 This is my story, this is my song,  
 Praising my Savior all the day long.
