[v1]
 Majestic sweetness sits enthroned 
 Upon the Savior’s brow; 
 His head with radiant glories crowned, 
 His lips with grace o’erflow, 
 His lips with grace o’erflow.
[v2]
 No mortal can with Him compare 
 Among the sons of men; 
 Fairer is He than all the fair
 That fill the heav’nly train, 
 That fill the heav’nly train.
[v3]
 To Him I owe my life and breath, 
 And all the joys I have; 
 He makes me triumph over death, 
 And saves me from the grave, 
 And saves me from the grave.
[v4]
 To heaven, the place of His abode, 
 He brings my weary feet;
 Shows me the glories of my God,
 And makes my joys complete, 
 And makes my joys complete. 
[v5]
 Since from His bounty I receive
 Such proofs of love divine,
 Had I a thousand hearts to give,
 Lord, they should all be Thine,
 Lord, they should all be Thine.
