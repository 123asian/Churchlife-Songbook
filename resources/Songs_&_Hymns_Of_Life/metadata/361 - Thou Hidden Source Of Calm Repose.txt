[v1]
 Thou hidden source of calm repose, 
 Thou all-sufficient love divine; 
 My help and refuge from my foes, 
 Secure I am, if Thou art mine; 
 From sin and grief, from guilt and shame, 
 I hide me, Jesus, in Thy name.
[v2]
 Thy mighty Name salvation is, 
 And keeps my happy soul above; 
 Comfort it brings, and pow’r, and peace, 
 And joy, and everlasting love; 
 To me, with Thy dear Name are giv’n 
 Pardon, and holiness, and heav’n.
[v3]
 Jesus, my all in all Thou art, 
 My rest in toil, mine ease in pain; 
 The med’cine of my broken heart; 
 In war, my peace; in loss, my gain; 
 My smile beneath the tyrant’s frown; 
 In shame, my glory and my crown.
[v4]
 In want, my plentiful supply; 
 In weakness, mine almighty pow’r; 
 In bonds, my perfect liberty; 
 My light in Satan’s darkest hour; 
 In grief, my joy unspeakable; 
 My life in death; my heav’n my all.
