[v1]
 Oh, what a Savior that He died for me! 
 From condemnation He hath made me free; 
 “He that believeth on the Son” saith He, 
 “Hath everlasting life.” 
[v2]
 All my iniquities on Him were laid, 
 All my indebtedness by Him was paid; 
 All who believe on Him, the Lord hath said, 
 “Hath everlasting life.”
[v3]
 Though poor and needy, I can trust my Lord; 
 Though weak and sinful, I believe His word; 
 Oh, glad message; every child of God 
 “Hath everlasting life.”
[v4]
 Though all unworthy, yet I will not doubt; 
 For him that cometh He will not cast out: 
 “He that believeth”— oh, the good news shout! 
 “Hath everlasting life.”
[c1]
 “Verily, verily, I say unto you;” 
 “Verily, verily,” message ever new!
 “He that believeth on the Son”— ’tis true— 
 “Hath everlasting life!”
