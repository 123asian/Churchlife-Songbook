[v1]
 Jesus, Thy life is mine, 
 Dwell evermore in me; 
 And let me see 
 That nothing can untwine 
 Thy life from mine.
[v2]
 Thy life in me be shown, 
 Lord, I would hence forth seek 
 To think and speak 
 Thy thoughts, Thy words alone, 
 No more my own.
[v3]
 Thy love, Thy joy, Thy peace, 
 Continuously impart 
 Unto my heart, 
 Fresh springs that never cease,  
 But still increase.
[v4]
 The blest reality 
 Of resurrection pow’r, 
 Thy Church’s dower, 
 Life more abundantly, 
 Lord, give to me.
[v5]
 Thy fullest gift, O Lord,
 Now at Thy word I claim,
 Through Thy dear Name,
 And touch the rapturous chord
 Of praise forth-poured.
[v6]
 Jesus, my life is Thine,
 And evermore shall be
 Hidden in Thee,
 For nothing can untwine
 Thy life from mine.
