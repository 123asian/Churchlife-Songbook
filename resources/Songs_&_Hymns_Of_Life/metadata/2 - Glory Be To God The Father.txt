[v1]
Glory be to God the Father,
And to Christ the Son,
Glory to the Holy Spirit—
Ever One.
[v2]
As we view the vast creation,
Planned with wondrous skill,
So our hearts would move to worship,
And be still.
[v3]
But, our God, how great Thy yearning
To have sons who love
In the Son e’en now to praise Thee,
Love to prove!
[v4]
’Twas Thy thought in revelation,
To present to men
Secrets of Thine own affections,
Theirs to win.
