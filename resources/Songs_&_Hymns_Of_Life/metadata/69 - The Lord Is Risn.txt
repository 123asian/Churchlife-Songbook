[v1]
 The Lord is ris’n; and death’s dark judgment flood 
 Is passed, in Him who bought us with His blood. 
 The Lord is ris’n: we stand beyond the doom 
 Of all our sin, through Jesus’ empty tomb.
[v2]
 The Lord is ris’n: with Him we also rose, 
 And in His grave see vanquished all our foes. 
 The Lord is ris’n; beyond the judgment land, 
 In Him, in resurrection life we stand.
[v3]
 The Lord is ris’n; and now redeemed to God, 
 We tread the desert which His feet have trod. 
 The Lord is ris’n: the sanctu’ry’s our place, 
 Where now we dwell before the Father’s face.
[v4]
 The Lord is ris’n: the Lord is gone before. 
 We long to see Him, and to sin no more. 
 The Lord is ris’n: our triumph-shout shall be, 
 “Thou hast prevailed! Thy people, Lord, are free!”
