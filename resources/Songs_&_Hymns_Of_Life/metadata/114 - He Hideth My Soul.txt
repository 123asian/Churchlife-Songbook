[v1]
 A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord, 
 A wonderful Savior to me; 
 He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, 
 Where rivers of pleasure I see.  
[v2]
 A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord, 
 He taketh my burden away; 
 He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved, 
 He giveth me strength as my day.
[v3]
 With numberless blessings each moment He crowns, 
 And, filled with His fulness divine, 
 I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God,
 For such a Redeemer as mine!
[v4]
 When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise 
 To meet Him in clouds of the sky, 
 His perfect salvation, His wonderful love, 
 Iâ€™ll shout with the millions on high.
[c1]
 He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock 
 That shadows a dry, thirsty land; 
 He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
 And covers me there with His hand, 
 And covers me there with His hand.
