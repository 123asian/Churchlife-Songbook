[v1]
 O Master, let me walk with Thee 
 In lowly paths of service free; 
 Tell me Thy secret, help me bear 
 The strain of toil, the fret of care.
[v2]
 Help me the slow of heart to move 
 By some clear, winning word of love; 
 Teach me the wayward feet to stay, 
 And guide them in the homeward way.
[v3]
 Teach me Thy patience; still with Thee 
 In closer, dearer company, 
 In work that keeps faith sweet and strong,
 In trust that triumphs over wrong.
[v4]
 In hope that sends a shining ray 
 Far down the future’s broad’ning way, 
 In peace that only Thou canst give, 
 With Thee, O Master, let me live.
