[v1]
 O Lord, to conflict new 
 You daily call your servant; 
 With joy and spirits fervent 
 We rise to follow You. 
 Lead us to battle too, 
 We are Your soldiers true. 
[v2]
 Fully equip us, Lord! 
 With faith and perseverance, 
 With wisdom and adherence, 
 With zeal and love outpoured; 
 Set us on fire, O Lord, 
 To win the great reward.
[v3]
 We lift up firm and high 
 The Cross, our banner glorious. 
 The enemy notorious 
 By Blood we dare defy. 
 To self the Cross apply, 
 On Christ alone rely.
[v4]
 Wrestle, suffer and pray! 
 The end shall be victorious. 
 The promised crown all-glorious 
 We shall receive one day. 
 Wrestle, suffer and pray! 
 We’ll reign with Christ for aye.
[c1]
 Our hands empow’r, Our hearts enflame! 
 We’ll overcome in Jesus’ name, 
 We’ll overcome in Jesus’ name! 
 Our hands empow’r, our hearts enflame!
