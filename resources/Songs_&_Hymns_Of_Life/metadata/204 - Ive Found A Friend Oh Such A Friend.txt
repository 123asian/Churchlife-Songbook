[v1]
 I’ve found a Friend, oh, such a Friend! 
 He loved me ere I knew Him; 
 He drew me with the cords of love, 
 And thus He bound me to Him.     
 And round my heart still closely twine 
 Those ties which naught can sever, 
 For I am His, and He is mine, 
 Forever and forever.
[v2]
 I’ve found a Friend, oh, such a Friend! 
 He bled, He died to save me; 
 And not alone the gift of life, 
 But His own self He gave me. 
 Naught that I have my own I call, 
 I hold it for the Giver; 
 My heart, my strength, my life, my all, 
 Are His, and His forever.
[v3]
 I’ve found a Friend, oh, such a Friend! 
 So kind, and true, and tender, 
 So wise a Counsellor and Guide, 
 So mighty a Defender! 
 From Him who loves me now so well, 
 What pow’r my soul can sever? 
 Shall life or death, shall earth or hell? 
 No! I am His forever.
