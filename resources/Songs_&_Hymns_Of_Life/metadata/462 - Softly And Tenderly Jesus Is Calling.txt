[v1]
 Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling, 
 Calling for you and for me; 
 Patiently Jesus is waiting and watching, 
 Watching for you and for me! 
[v2]
 Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading, 
 Pleading for you and for me? 
 Why should we linger and heed not His mercies, 
 Mercies for you and for me?
[v3]
 Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing, 
 Passing from you and from me; 
 Shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming, 
 Coming for you and for me!
[v4]
 Oh, for the wonderful love He has promised, 
 Promised for you and for me! 
 Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon, 
 Pardon for you and for me!
[c1]
 Come home! come home! 
 Ye who are weary, come home! 
 Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, 
 Calling, O sinner, come home!
