[v1]
 Lord Jesus, You are so beautiful 
 And in Your person peace abides to soothe my soul. 
 Oh Jesus, be my light and my love; 
 Though I’m in shadows of the earth, 
 I think only above. 
[v2]
 And if my mind from my spirit part, 
 If doubts and fears should hold my heart and control my thoughts; 
 Then, Lord, press faith into my heart, 
 Seal me and claim me as Your own; 
 By Your blood I’m bought.
[c1]
 Lord Jesus, take from me all my empty yearnings. 
 Make me to give to You all my nights and mornings.
 I want a clear sky between us, and a well-lit straight way. 
 Lord guide me every moment today.
