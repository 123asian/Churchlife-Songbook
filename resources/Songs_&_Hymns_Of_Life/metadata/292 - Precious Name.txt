[v1]
 Take the name of Jesus with you, 
 Child of sorrow and of woe; 
 It will joy and comfort give you, 
 Take it then where’er you go. 
[v2]
 Take the name of Jesus ever, 
 As a shield from every snare. 
 If temptations round you gather,
 Breathe that holy name in prayer.
[v3]
 O, the precious name of Jesus! 
 How it thrills our souls with joy; 
 When His loving arms receive us, 
 And His songs our tongues employ!
[v4]
 At the name of Jesus bowing, 
 Falling prostrate at His feet, 
 King of Kings in heav’n we’ll crown Him, 
 When our journey is complete.
[c1]
 Precious name! Oh, how sweet! 
 Hope of earth and joy of heav’n; 
 Precious name! Oh, how sweet! 
 Hope of earth and joy of heav’n.
