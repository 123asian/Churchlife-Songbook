[v1]
 The name of Jesus is so sweet, 
 I love its music to repeat; 
 It makes my joys full and complete, 
 The precious name of Jesus. 
[v2]
 I love the name of Him whose heart 
 Knows all my griefs and bears a part; 
 Who bids all anxious fears depart, 
 I love the name of Jesus.
[v3]
 That name I fondly love to hear, 
 It never fails my heart to cheer, 
 Its music dries the falling tear; 
 Exalt the name of Jesus.
[v4]
 No word of man can ever tell 
 How sweet the name I love so well,  
 Oh, let its praises ever swell, 
 Oh, praise the name of Jesus.
[c1]
 Jesus! oh, how sweet the name, 
 Jesus! every day the same; 
 Jesus! let all saints proclaim 
 Its worthy praise forever.
