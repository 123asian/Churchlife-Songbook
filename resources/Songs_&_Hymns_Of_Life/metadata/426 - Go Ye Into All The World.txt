[v1]
 Far, far away, in heathen darkness dwelling, 
 Millions of souls forever may be lost; 
 Who, who will go, salvation’s story telling, 
 Looking to Jesus, counting not the cost? 
[v2]
 See o’er the world, wide open doors inviting: 
 Soldiers of Christ, arise and enter in! 
 Christians, awake! your forces all uniting, 
 Send forth the Gospel, break the chains of sin.
[v3]
 “Why will ye die?” the voice of God is calling, 
 “Why will ye die?” reecho in His Name: 
 Jesus has died to save from death appalling, 
 Life and salvation, therefore go proclaim.
[c1]
 “All pow’r is given unto Me, 
 All pow’r is given unto Me, 
 Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel,
 And lo, I am with you alway.”
